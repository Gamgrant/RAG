Welcome to the City of Pittsburgh’s first Resident Guide.

After months of preparation we are excited to launch this resource for you. Resident Guides offer helpful information 
                                about citywide services and resources and function as a one-stop shop for resident needs. This is the first of several 
                                guides we hope to publish on the website, each curated for a different community in Pittsburgh and translated into 
                                different languages. To ensure accuracy, relevance, and cultural appropriateness the team sought input from a diverse 
                                group of stakeholders.  It is our hope that you will find the content of the guide useful. You can browse the categories in the menu to the right.
The city launched a new website in the fall of 2017. Part of the goals of the new site was to provide the opportunity for 
                                Resident Guides to be created. After consulting various groups, it was decided that the first guide should be targeted 
                                toward the Hispanic/Latinx communities. We collected feedback from service providers, community members and local leaders 
                                in the Hispanic/Latinx community about what resources and topics are most important to individuals who are new to 
                                Pittsburgh. After collecting all of the information, we created anEnglish guidethat was then translated into Spanish by 
                                Nereida Daza of the Latino Community Center.
As information changes, it is our goal to update the guide every three months.  If you see information that is incorrect, 
                                or if you wish to contribute to the content, please email Welcoming Pittsburgh atwelcomingpgh@pittsburghpa.gov.

EXPLORE NEARLY 3,800 ACRES OVER 176 PARKS

Our regional parks are the signature open spaces of Pittsburgh.
These parks draw tens of thousands of visitors from throughout our City and the region. The public can attend grand civic events, play, and learn. 
				Each park has a unique identity shaped by its cultural resources, historic landscape, natural features, and recreational amenities.
The Department of Public Works and CitiParks maintain approximately 1,920 acres of regional park land distributed across five parks.
We maintain approximately 300 acres of community park land.
Community parks draw people from more than one neighborhood because of the features or character they offer, and they are intended to serve
				multiple neighborhoods.
Neighborhood parks are the basic building blocks within the Pittsburgh’s parks system.
These locally-oriented parks provide residents with nearby access to the outdoors and recreation. Neighborhood parks typically include features 
					such as picnic areas, playgrounds, open lawn, courts, and walking paths. Find your neighborhood park below. (If the park you are looking at has a court, field or shelter you 
                                        would like to permit, please click on the Column Header to navigate to the appropriate permit page.)

River access is highly valued in Pittsburgh. We maintain approximately 51 acres of riverfront parks. Many partner organizations such as the 
					Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Sports & Exhibition Authority also maintain signature public riverfront properties.
Our riverfronts also feature a significant public trail system along the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio riverfronts.

Rec2Tech

The Office of the Mayor began the conversation of connecting kids of all colors in the urban community to 21st Century tech skill sets.  By providing a safe space in their community to foster those skills we at CitiParks look forward to fulfilling this mission through our Rec2Tech programming.
Rec2Tech will demonstrate how we can use existing city resources to increase access to technology for; and provide young people with the 21st Century learning opportunities they will need to succeed in innovation and technology fields. Ultimately, Rec2Tech will help bridge the divide and provide access to opportunities for people in their own neighborhood and community.
One of the ways in which CitiParks has been able to get our Rec2Tech Program started is through an award from the National Science Foundation. With this funding,Citiparks has teamed up with Baltimore City and the Digital Harbor Foundationto address the digital divide through innovative Rec2Tech programming.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari).

Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information and Processing/Sharing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base. Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt out of the disclosure of your personal information for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” or processing for purposes of targeted advertising, please visit "Your Privacy Choices" which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.
Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do sohere.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to access and use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Policy.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base.

Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.
Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do sohere.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

Right to Revise.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to access and use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Policy.

Whenever you sign a document using E-Signatures you affirmatively consent to using electronic signatures via the E-Signatures and consent to conducting electronic business transactions. You also confirm that you are able to access the E-Signatures and the document you are signing electronically. When using E-Signatures for a document, your consent applies only to the matter(s) covered by that particular document.
- Right to Opt-Out of E-Signatures. You are not required to use E-Signatures or accept electronic documents provided thereby.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Rights Regarding Your Information
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right, in accordance with applicable data protection laws, to make requests related to your “personal information” or “personal data” (as such terms are defined under applicable law, and collectively referred to herein as “personal information”).

Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you.

Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information and Processing/Sharing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base. Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt out of the disclosure of your personal information for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” or processing for purposes of targeted advertising, please visit "Your Privacy Choices" which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.
Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements.

If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying us that your copyrighted material has been infringed. We do not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. We may contact the notice provider to request additional information. Under the DMCA, we are required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content (“Alleged Infringer”). The Alleged Infringer is allowed under the law to send us a counter-notification. Notices and counter-notices are legal notices distinct from regular activities or communications through the Service. We may publish or share them with third parties in our sole discretion (in addition to producing them pursuant to a subpoena or other legal discovery request). Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Any person who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney.
To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by regular mail only. We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated to, respond to a non-compliant notice.
A DMCA notice must:
- Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, “My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location where material is located].”);
- Identify the content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work. The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Service. The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible;
- Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available);
- If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);
- Include the following statement: “I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”;
- nclude the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”;
- Be signed; and
- Be sent to our DMCA designated agent at the following address:NEOGOVAttention: DMCA Designated Agent2120 Park Place, Suite 100El Segundo, California 90245Or by e-mail:If you are a job seeker, please contact:support@GovernmentJobs.comIf you are a Customer (an employer), please contact:customersupport@GovernmentJobs.com

Whenever you sign a document using E-Signatures you affirmatively consent to using electronic signatures via the E-Signatures and consent to conducting electronic business transactions.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base.

Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.
Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do sohere.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

Right to Revise.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to access and use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Policy.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari).

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right, in accordance with applicable data protection laws, to make requests related to your “personal information” or “personal data” (as such terms are defined under applicable law, and collectively referred to herein as “personal information”).

Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you.

Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information and Processing/Sharing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base. Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt out of the disclosure of your personal information for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” or processing for purposes of targeted advertising, please visit "Your Privacy Choices" which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do sohere.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to access and use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Policy.

Copyright Infringement.   Our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Copyright-infringing materials found on the Services can be identified and removed via our process listed below, and you agree to comply with such process in the event you are involved in any claim of copyright infringement to which the DMCA may be applicable.
If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying us that your copyrighted material has been infringed. We do not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. We may contact the notice provider to request additional information.

We may publish or share them with third parties in our sole discretion (in addition to producing them pursuant to a subpoena or other legal discovery request). Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Any person who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney.
To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by regular mail only. We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated to, respond to a non-compliant notice.
A DMCA notice must:
- Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, “My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location where material is located].”);
- Identify the content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work. The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Service. The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible;
- Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available);
- If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);
- Include the following statement: “I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”;
- nclude the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”;
- Be signed; and
- Be sent to our DMCA designated agent at the following address:NEOGOVAttention: DMCA Designated Agent2120 Park Place, Suite 100El Segundo, California 90245Or by e-mail:If you are a job seeker, please contact:support@GovernmentJobs.comIf you are a Customer (an employer), please contact:customersupport@GovernmentJobs.com

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base.

Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.
Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do sohere.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

Right to Revise.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to access and use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Policy.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari).

Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information and Processing/Sharing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base. Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt out of the disclosure of your personal information for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” or processing for purposes of targeted advertising, please visit "Your Privacy Choices" which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.
Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do sohere.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to access and use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Policy.

- If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);
- Include the following statement: “I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”;
- nclude the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”;

Whenever you sign a document using E-Signatures you affirmatively consent to using electronic signatures via the E-Signatures and consent to conducting electronic business transactions. You also confirm that you are able to access the E-Signatures and the document you are signing electronically.

Provide the physical mobility necessary to support the social and economic mobility of the people of Pittsburgh through the management, design, improvement, and operation of the public right of way.
What we do.
The Department is responsible for the transportation of people and goods throughout the City of Pittsburgh, and for managing the operation of and access to the public right-of-way (the sidewalks, curbs, streets, and bridges that make up our network).
City's Mobility Principles:
- No one dies or is seriously injured traveling on city streets.
- Every household in Pittsburgh can access fresh fruits and vegetables within 20 minutes travel of home, without the requirement of a private vehicle.
- All trips less than 1 mile are easily and enjoyably achieved by non-vehicle travel.
- No household must spend more than 45% of household income to satisfy basic housing, transportation and energy needs.
- The design, maintenance and operation of city streets reflects the values of our community.
Research finds that access to transportation is the factor most likely to influence household economic success (https://www.planetizen.com/node/76552). With this in mind, the mission of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is to provide the transportation mobility essential to the economic mobility of all Pittsburghers.

Welcome to the Office of Film & Event Management

The Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) is the official permitting authority for block parties, special events, first amendment activity, and film projects in the City of Pittsburgh. To support the city’s rapidly growing event & film industry, the Office of Film & Event Management has streamlined the permitting process for event organizers and film producers via efficient digital permitting. In addition to streamlining the permitting process for events & film projects in the City of Pittsburgh, the Office of Film & Event Management will also be responsible for the following:
OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh as well as consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met. Via the Special Events Committee, OFEM also works with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of all events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City’s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents.
- Issuing permits to events and productions filming on public property in the City of Pittsburgh.
- Facilitating communication between event organizers, film producers, and city departments and authorities.
- Handling cost recovery efforts for City services related to event & film needs.
- Handling permitting for block-parties and community festivals in addition to special events and films.
- Consulting on major and minor civic events within the City.

New Permit Management System Launch!

Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) will be launching a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system comes a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process will allow event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants would need to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants can secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they have a secure venue and dates.
Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the “Getting Started: Event Permits” for information on the entire permitting process!

New Features with Eproval!

In addition to being able to secure their event venue prior to completing all event-specific details, Eproval provides several new exciting features that will make the event permitting process more streamlined for applicants. Among them:
- Scalable Application:During Phase Two of the application, applicants will be asked a series of yes/no questions up front, such as but not limited to: “will your event have a stage?” and “will you be having fireworks?” This allows the system to custom build an application specific to that event. If the event takes place in a park and does not impact any roadways, the applicant will not be presented with questions about road closures. If an event will not have fireworks, the applicant will not have to answer any questions about fireworks. This will minimize the length of the application for small community events, while larger more complex events will require more information.
- Public Event Calendar:During the application process, applicants will be given the opportunity to opt-in to our brand new public event calendar. This will be a forward facing calendar that will list all pending and approved event applications. Applicants who opt into being on the calendar can provide contact info and website information, as well as a quick two to three sentence marketing pitch. This calendar will be available on the City’s website for anyone to find when looking for things to do in the City.
For general information and guidance, please reach out to the Office of Film & Event Management at the contact info below.

About Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh was founded on November 27, 1758. The city was named byGeneral John Forbes, in honor of British statesmanWilliam Pitt, the 1st Earl of Chatham. Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in our country’s history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the “Gateway to the West.” This nickname referenced the huge advantage Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is known as the “point” to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for products such as coal, timber, glass, natural gas, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nation’s steel. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - “The Smoky City."
Throughout the years, Pittsburgh has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has moved from the steel industry to become a leader in healthcare, education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily polluted streets and riverfronts, have been transformed to create the modern vibrant Pittsburgh one sees today.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the sixth largest populated state in the United States. Pittsburgh is the second largest city in Pennsylvania and has an estimated of 310,000 people. The population consists of 51.9% females and 48.9% males, with the average age being 33. Pittsburgh, serves as the County Seat of Allegheny County which has an estimated population of 1.2 million. Pittsburgh serves as the principal city of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area, or Greater Pittsburgh. This 8 county area has an estimated population of 2.6 million.
The City of Pittsburgh offers everything a person might be looking for in a home, with its wonderful shopping areas, great restaurants, and beautiful views. Pittsburgh is known for having more named neighborhoods than any American city. Ninety distinct communities collectively create the culture of Pittsburgh. The Strip District is a wonderful market spot known for its variety of food and an excellent shopping with unique stores. The neighborhoods known as Shadyside, Beechview, or the West End are other fantastic region of Pittsburgh to find trendy shops and restaurants. If you’re looking for authentic homemade Italian food, Bloomfield or “Pittsburgh’s Little Italy” is the place for you. If you’re looking for more of a creative and artistic side of Pittsburgh, pass through the neighborhood of Lawrenceville.
East Liberty is known as for business and industries. Looking for a fun night out on the town? South Side has a fun and exciting nightlife full of clubs, sports bars, and laid-back pubs. Wanting to catch a game or spend some quality time with your loved ones? The North Shore or North Side is the place to be. Mount Washington is the high point of Pittsburgh; it gives the residents of Pittsburgh and tourists a beautiful view of this magnificent city. Finally, Downtown, like most downtown districts, has great food, dining, parks, plazas, and art museums.
Pittsburgh Public Schools strives to accelerate student achievement, eliminate racial inequalities, foster innovations and create positive atmosphere. There are a total of 23 elementary schools, 7 middle schools, 4 high schools, 11 schools serving grades K-8, 5 schools serving grades 6-12, and 4 specialty schools. The district is governed by the elected Board of Public Education of Pittsburgh. The City of Pittsburgh Controller and Treasurer serve dual roles in the School District of Pittsburgh.
For higher education there are countless and qualified options. The University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, Carlow University, Point Park University, and Carnegie Mellon University are just a few universities located in the City of Pittsburgh. There are even more just outside the city such as Robert Morris University, Washington & Jefferson, and La Roche College.

Community Development Block Grant

The Community Development Block Grant program, abbreviated to CDBG, is funding from the Federal Government that goes to local governments like the City of Pittsburgh. Congress allocates CDBG funds from the federal budget, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) manages the program nationally. CDBG funds must be used to benefit people with low to moderate incomes.
The Community Development Division is responsible for the administration of the CDBG program for the City of Pittsburgh. Serving as a catalyst for development in the City's neighborhoods, this program distributes grants for a wide range of projects which address the housing, economic, and human service needs of low and moderate income residents and neighborhoods. The City uses CDBG funds for general public improvement projects such as sidewalk repairs and demolishing vacant buildings. Funds are also awarded to local nonprofit organizations asPublic Service GrantsorNeighborhood Economic Development Grants.
HUD has a library of resources available on theirExplore CDBGpage, designed to help community develpment professionals leverage grant funds effectively. For a deeper dive in the regulations that the City of Pittsburgh must follow you can view HUD'sCDBG Entitlement Program Eligibility Requirements.

In 1794, the newly formed Borough of Pittsburgh established a Public Market House in the current location of Market Square. Aside from creating 
                                        the public market tradition that continues there today, this location was also home to the very first Pittsburgh Municipal Hall. As Pittsburgh 
                                        continued to grow, so would the space required for government services. The Market House quickly became obsolete and the cornerstone of a new 
                                        City Hall was laid at Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue in May of 1869. The County, which first courthouse was also in this location moved 
                                        to its current location on Grant Street in 1836. The Smithield Street City Hall would serve until the completion of the City-County Building 
                                        in 1917. It would sit abandoned for 50 years before sold for a redevelopment in the 1950's.

In 1911, a City of Pittsburgh Commission was formed by unanimous resolution of Council for the construction of a new City Hall. The Commission, 
                                        which by 1913 had been joined by the appropriate members representing Allegheny County, employed New York architect Cass Gilbert to arrange a 
                                        competition for the design of a new municipal building. Of the 16 entries, the winning design was submitted by the firm Palmer, Hornbostel, & 
                                        Jones of New York, who were represented locally by Edward B. Lee. The plans were officially adopted on January 19, 1914, and began the 
                                        following year. The building acted as a gift to Pittsburgh to honor the 1916 Centennial of Pittsburgh's 1816 incorporation as a City. At the 
                                        March 1916 dedication ceremony, Mayor Joseph Armstrong placed a time capsule into the still under construction building. Two and a half years 
                                        later in December 1917, he would become the first Mayor to call the City-County Building a second home. The missing time capsule has yet to be 
                                        discovered.

The Grand Lobby of the City-County Building, is one of the building's most beautiful spaces. The room extends the length of the building, 
                                        connecting Grant Street to Ross Street. The 30-foot wide hall is topped off by a 47-foot high barrel-vaulted ceiling. On the first floor, the 
                                        marble lined hall is flanked by a series of row offices that contain the public service offices most often visited - the County's marriage 
                                        license and passports, and Pittsburgh's Controller, and Treasury offices. The offices form a base on which sit the bronze classical columns 
                                        that support the vaulted ceiling. The columns are works of art themselves, manufactured by Louis Tiffany Studios. They feature, in a rotating 
                                        series at their bases, the Seals of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, as well as iconic local frontiersman Guyasuta and Pittsburgh's oldest 
                                        surviving building, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse. The rooms ornate elevator doors feature a series of reliefs detailing the previous homes of 
                                        municipal government. The reliefs age with the building's they clutch, reaching adulthood with the present City-County Building and Allegheny 
                                        County Courthouse.

In 1972 the City of Pittsburgh moved Phipps Fall Flower show to the City-County Building. It would return to Phipps Conservatory in 
                                                    1975.

The offical statue of Sir William Pitt was a gift to Pittsburgh from Sir Charles Wakefield Baronet, the former Lord Mayor of London 
                                                    in 1922.
The place where much of Pittsburgh's future was shaped, the Office of the Mayor, has played the role of a second home to every Cheif Executive 
                                        of Pittsburgh since 1917. These two state rooms have gone virtually unchanged in the last century. Most of the furniture, including the iconic Desk, are 
                                        original to the building's opening and were custom designed by Hornbostel.

The Chamber is one of Pittsburgh's most distinct spaces. This state room is home to the legislative operations of the Council of Pittsburgh, 
                                        the room also carries a historical record. The ornate plaster ceiling details the names of the municipalities which have been annexed in 
                                        making up present day Pittsburgh. It also features the names of Pittsburgh's past Mayors. Having since outgrown the ceiling, many names now expand to the rooms 
                                        hand-painted canvas walls. The room is completed with detailed walnut wainscoting which features the beautiful inlaid Pittsburgh Crest. 
                                        Much like the Office of the Mayor, all of the furniture in the Chamber is original to the building's construction.

As home to both the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County offices, the upper floors of the City-County Building are home to a large part of 
                                        the courts system. The most famous tenant being the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Supreme Court splits its time 
                                        between the state's three major areas, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and the State Capitol, Harrisburg. The ornate plaster ceiling features murals 
                                        of 3 major historical law givers: Justinian - representing Roman law, Moses - for Judaic law, & King Edward representing English law. In 
                                        addition it includes the dates of the completion of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Its hand painted canvas walls feature 
                                        large murals of William Penn, the namesake of the Commonwealth, and William Pitt, the namesake of Pittsburgh, as well as the portraits of 
                                        Supreme Court Justices from the Western District. The room is completed with mahogany wainscoting and furniture.

But City data isn’t a log of when and where we put our park­ing chairs. It’s a huge col­lect­ion of in­form­ation about the world a­round us that can help us under­stand what’s happen­ing in our neigh­bor­hoods, and lead us to ideas and decis­ions that can make where we live bet­ter. We think of it as neb­by for the great­er good.
So, whether you’re look­ing at in­form­at­ion about side­walks that need re­pair­ing, or map­ping out street­lights that are a lit­tle too dim, re­mem­ber: While data can help us know, its high­est pur­pose is to help us join to­get­her with other re­sid­ents and the City to make change.

Ok, so how do I use it?

Burgh’s Eye View uses maps to visualize data generated by the City of Pittsburgh and its residents. As you play with it—changing the date range, for example—what you see on the map will change. You can scroll to zoom or use the +/- buttons at the top left, click on pins to see details, and move the map around using a mouse or touch.
Currently, three general map types are available: maps of points, places and parcels.
The points map shows data located at specific points in the city, such as public safety incidents, 311 requests, code violations, capital projects, and city assets.
Also, if you like videos, check out these how-tos produced by our Cable Channel:
- Introduction and Overview
- Use Case: Public Safety
- Downloading Data
The Places map allows you to view a wide range of City assets, including bridges and recreation space, steps, pools, historic districts, flood zones, traffic signals, and more.
The Parcels map allows you to view, at the neighborhood level, delinquent properties, City-owned properties, and properties in a tax abatement program. You can also view information about any specific parcel, including type of owner, property class, sale information, county land value, and potential liens. Some information, including the owner’s name, is not included in order to protect people's privacy. While data on properties that are tax delinquent, in a tax abatement program, or city-owned comes from the City of Pittsburgh, all other data on the Parcels maps comes our partners at Allegheny County.

Wait, why are things where they are?

Markers or “pins” for each dataset show up on the map differently depending on the source. Public Safety pins are geocoded by the block or intersection of the incident or arrest using Allegheny County's geocoder, every night. Code violations are geocoded at the center of their respective parcel, which is determined by Allegheny County. 311 Requests are first geocoded by the City's 311 request tracking system. To maintain citizens' privacy these requests are then specially obfuscated. This process is handled by theWestern Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, and they describe it this way:

Wow, is there more like this?

Whenever possible, Burgh’s Eye View will point you to other resources for the data or information you are viewing. This includes links to theAllegheny County Real Estate Portal, the311 Request Online Form, and theCity Online Facility Rentalpage. All of these resources are available 24/7, just like Burgh’s Eye View.
This page has lots of links to other City data, information and resources, and you can find more atpittsburghpa.govor by following the city onTwitterandFacebook.
And yes there are more projects like this to come! You can write to the team that built this atanalytics@pittsburghpa.gov. We'd love to hear your feedback, ideas, and hopes for the future of data in the City of Pittsburgh. (But please note that we may not be able to respond individually.)
Burgh’s Eye View is an initiative of theDepartment of the Innovation & Performance’s Analytics & Strategy Team. We work under the vision and leadership of Mayor Bill Peduto, who has from day one been committed to being transparent and open with City data.

We are not accepting sign-ups for Snow Angel volunteers or recipients at this time. If you would like to be notified when sign-ups do open, please fill out this form.
Thank you, we'll be in touch when the 2024-2025 season kicks off this fall!

What is the Snow Angels Program?

Helping your neighbors is SNOW much fun!
Snow-covered sidewalks can be hazardous for everyone. The City of Pittsburgh’s Snow Angels Program pairs older residents and residents with disabilities with nearby neighbors who volunteer to assist them with snow removal on their sidewalks and walkways.
Along with fostering stronger community relationships and relieving some of the stress that comes from a snowfall or freeze, Snow Angels make our sidewalks safer for those who are outside during the winter weather, like postal carriers, firefighters, police officers, and other neighbors.
In 2023, we encouraged couches, faith-based and community leaders to sign up their groups as Snow Angels to support their neighbors in need.

Requirements for Snow Angel Recipients

We are not accepting applications for Snow Angel service at this time.Follow this page, or leave your contact information in the form above to be notified when the program reopens for the 2024-2025 season.

If you’d like a neighbor to come help break the ice!
Here are the requirements neighbors must meet to request a Snow Angel:
Be at least 62 years old, or have a physical disability.
Live within the City of Pittsburgh.Click hereto find out if you live within city limits.
Do not have resources (financial or family and friends nearby) to assist with snow removal.
Things to know before signing up:
- You are not guaranteed assistance. Service depends on if there’s a Snow Angel who has signed up to volunteer near you. Our staff works closely with the community to do the best volunteer recruitment and outreach we can, but we cannot guarantee you will be matched.
- If you are matched with a volunteer, we will notify you by email or phone call. Registration is on a rolling basis, so a Snow Angel may be available later in the season. We will contact you when you have a match.
- You may not receive immediate help during a snowfall. Please give your volunteer a reasonable amount of time to assist you - we recommend allowing 24-hours after a snow event concludes. Your Snow Angel may have work, family, or personal matters that prevent them from immediately shoveling and salting your sidewalk or walkway.
- You do not have to be home when a volunteer arrives to help.

Volunteer FAQ

- We will contact volunteers via email with confirmation details when they have been assigned a neighbor.
- Volunteers and recipients may not be assigned immediately. Neighbors request help throughout the winter season. Volunteers may be assigned immediately, a few weeks after signing up, or later during the winter.
- Volunteer assignments depend on if a neighbor nearby needs help. If no neighbors sign up, we may not be able to assign volunteers. Either way, we will keep in touch!
- We ask that volunteers help out neighbors as soon as they are able, and within 24-hours of the end of a snow event.
- If volunteers are willing to help shovel and salt for more than one neighbor, please let us know on the sign-up form. We'll do our best to match you with another nearby neighbor.

Recipient FAQ

- Volunteers and recipients may not be assigned immediately, but we'll let both parties know when they have been assigned.
- We ask that volunteers help out neighbors as soon as they are able, and within 24-hours of the end of a snow event.

Snow Plow Tracker App v.2.0

What does the Plow Tracker 2.0 show me?
The Plow Tracker v 2.0 displays the history trail of Public Works vehicles conducting deicing and/or anti-icing and plowing operations. Vehicle travel on City streets is displayed with a pink history trail.
Street treatment efforts can be tracked within the last 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours by selecting the desired interval below the map.
Roads are color-coded to show the City’s treatment responsibilities.

=== Table ===
City Treatment Responsibility:    
White – City (City Responsibility)
=== End of Table ===

=== Table ===
Other Treatment Responsibility:         
Light Blue: City (County Responsibility)
Yellow – State (State Responsibility)   
Green – County (County responsibility)  
Lilac – Private
=== End of Table ===
Where are the trucks treating the city’s streets?
Current vehicle location is displayed with a vehicle icon on the screen on the “Now” and 2, 4, 12, and 24 interval time displays.
The Plow Tracker v 2.0 does not display the current location of vehicles traveling slower than 2.5 m.p.h., or if the ignition is off. To ensure drivers are able to treat the roads without interruption, vehicle icons are presented with a time delay.
How can I navigate to my street?
Users of the Plow Tracker 2.0 can zoom in on the map to view their street or select their street from the drop-down menu located below the history display buttons.
What does treatment mean?
Treatment is the application of anti-icing (before snow and ice arrive) and / or deicing (after snow / ice have fallen) materials. While their application indicates that the street has been treated it does not indicate that a street will be clear of any snow/ ice – that will happen when the temperatures are favorable (rising, not falling), the sun is prevalent and pedestrians and vehicles work the deicing and/or anti-icing material.
Primary and secondary streets are treated simultaneously but during heavy snow or changing weather conditions Public Works vehicles may return to treating only primaries prior to returning to secondary and tertiary routes. The streets are categorized based on traffic volume.
Who owns/maintains the street?
In addition to City streets, Public Works conducts deicing and/or anti-icing operations on certain Allegheny County, and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania roads.
Later this winter weather season we will update the Plow Tracker map to display city snow and ice treatment responsibility.
Why do trucks go on streets that the city does not own or maintain?
There are times that Public Works vehicles travel on streets they do not own or maintain:
- To efficiently connect to streets the city treats.
- To return to Public Works Division maintenance garages.
- To load more deicing and/or anti-icing materials.
Why did the truck go halfway up the street and turn around?
To apply deicing and/or anti-icing materials to streets during a winter weather event Public Works drivers may turn their vehicle around and back up steep hills because this is the most efficient and safest manner to treat the street. In other instances, drivers may encounter difficulty accessing narrow streets when cars are parked too far into the roadway. In such cases, the driver has to return in the hope the vehicle has moved or return with a smaller piece of equipment.
Why is my de-icing material blue?
For the 2018-19 winter weather season, Public Works is treating roads with a new rock salt made of Magnesium Chloride instead of Sodium Chloride treated with liquid Calcium Chloride. Magnesium Chloride is expected to have a lower melting point and better deicing capabilities, particularly at lower temperatures. Our new deicing material is treated with a blue pigment that enables residents and drivers to be better able to determine if the street has recently been treated.
How can I help Public Works treat my street?
When driving:
- Don’t drive if you don’t have to!
- If you can delay your trip to allow our crews to get deicing and/or anti-icing materials down please do so.
- If you do, give the plow operators space to operate.
When parking:
- Don’t park your car on a corner.
- If you have the ability to move your car off the street, we encourage you to do so.
- Don’t park your car too far in the street.
When shoveling:
- Don’t shovel your snow into your street.
- Don’t clear your car into the street; clear it before you’re driving.
Please be patient and give our crews the time needed to treat over 1,200 miles of streets.
What are the snow levels and what do they mean?
Public Works classifies storm conditions into Levels, which determine the required response for a given winter weather event. Based on the Levels, residents and drivers can expect that all streets will be treated in the following manner. Know that while there are periods when it is not snowing, that does not mean the weather event has ended.
Level 0: No service response required.
Level 1:
- 0.5" - 3" forecasted snow or ice
- Standard deployment of snow removal resources
- Salting/plowing as needed
- Large equipment assigned to primary routes
- Small equipment assigned to secondary routes
Level 2:
- 3" - 6" forecasted snow or ice
- Salting/plowing as needed
- Emphasis on primary routes
- Small equipment assigned to secondary routes
- All DPW vehicles and equipment put into plow mode
- Recommend that resident vehicles be moved from side streets and alleys
Level 3:
- 6" - 10" forecasted snow or ice
- Salting/plowing as needed
- Heavy emphasis on emergency routes and primary routes; secondary and tertiary routes follow accordingly
- All DPW vehicles and equipment put into plow mode
- Parking restrictions enforced (Citations may be issued to vehicles that pose a danger or impede snow removal efforts.)
Level 4:
- 10+" forecasted snow or ice
- Full deployment of snow removal resources
- Primary focus on emergency routes, with primary, secondary and tertiary following accordingly
- Parking restrictions enforced (Citations may be issued to vehicles that pose a danger or impede snow removal efforts.)
- Use of pre-qualified contractors activated as needed

Welcome to the Office of Film & Event Management

The Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) is the official permitting authority for block parties, special events, first amendment activity, and film projects in the City of Pittsburgh. To support the city’s rapidly growing event & film industry, the Office of Film & Event Management has streamlined the permitting process for event organizers and film producers via efficient digital permitting. In addition to streamlining the permitting process for events & film projects in the City of Pittsburgh, the Office of Film & Event Management will also be responsible for the following:
OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh as well as consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met. Via the Special Events Committee, OFEM also works with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of all events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City’s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents.
- Issuing permits to events and productions filming on public property in the City of Pittsburgh.
- Facilitating communication between event organizers, film producers, and city departments and authorities.
- Handling cost recovery efforts for City services related to event & film needs.
- Handling permitting for block-parties and community festivals in addition to special events and films.
- Consulting on major and minor civic events within the City.

New Permit Management System Launch!

Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) will be launching a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system comes a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process will allow event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants would need to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants can secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they have a secure venue and dates.
Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the “Getting Started: Event Permits” for information on the entire permitting process!

New Features with Eproval!

In addition to being able to secure their event venue prior to completing all event-specific details, Eproval provides several new exciting features that will make the event permitting process more streamlined for applicants. Among them:
- Scalable Application:During Phase Two of the application, applicants will be asked a series of yes/no questions up front, such as but not limited to: “will your event have a stage?” and “will you be having fireworks?” This allows the system to custom build an application specific to that event. If the event takes place in a park and does not impact any roadways, the applicant will not be presented with questions about road closures. If an event will not have fireworks, the applicant will not have to answer any questions about fireworks. This will minimize the length of the application for small community events, while larger more complex events will require more information.
- Public Event Calendar:During the application process, applicants will be given the opportunity to opt-in to our brand new public event calendar. This will be a forward facing calendar that will list all pending and approved event applications. Applicants who opt into being on the calendar can provide contact info and website information, as well as a quick two to three sentence marketing pitch. This calendar will be available on the City’s website for anyone to find when looking for things to do in the City.
For general information and guidance, please reach out to the Office of Film & Event Management at the contact info below.

About Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh was founded on November 27, 1758. The city was named byGeneral John Forbes, in honor of British statesmanWilliam Pitt, the 1st Earl of Chatham. Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in our country’s history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the “Gateway to the West.” This nickname referenced the huge advantage Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is known as the “point” to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for products such as coal, timber, glass, natural gas, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nation’s steel. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - “The Smoky City."
Throughout the years, Pittsburgh has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has moved from the steel industry to become a leader in healthcare, education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily polluted streets and riverfronts, have been transformed to create the modern vibrant Pittsburgh one sees today.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the sixth largest populated state in the United States. Pittsburgh is the second largest city in Pennsylvania and has an estimated of 310,000 people. The population consists of 51.9% females and 48.9% males, with the average age being 33. Pittsburgh, serves as the County Seat of Allegheny County which has an estimated population of 1.2 million. Pittsburgh serves as the principal city of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area, or Greater Pittsburgh. This 8 county area has an estimated population of 2.6 million.
The City of Pittsburgh offers everything a person might be looking for in a home, with its wonderful shopping areas, great restaurants, and beautiful views. Pittsburgh is known for having more named neighborhoods than any American city. Ninety distinct communities collectively create the culture of Pittsburgh. The Strip District is a wonderful market spot known for its variety of food and an excellent shopping with unique stores. The neighborhoods known as Shadyside, Beechview, or the West End are other fantastic region of Pittsburgh to find trendy shops and restaurants. If you’re looking for authentic homemade Italian food, Bloomfield or “Pittsburgh’s Little Italy” is the place for you. If you’re looking for more of a creative and artistic side of Pittsburgh, pass through the neighborhood of Lawrenceville.
East Liberty is known as for business and industries. Looking for a fun night out on the town? South Side has a fun and exciting nightlife full of clubs, sports bars, and laid-back pubs. Wanting to catch a game or spend some quality time with your loved ones? The North Shore or North Side is the place to be. Mount Washington is the high point of Pittsburgh; it gives the residents of Pittsburgh and tourists a beautiful view of this magnificent city. Finally, Downtown, like most downtown districts, has great food, dining, parks, plazas, and art museums.
Pittsburgh Public Schools strives to accelerate student achievement, eliminate racial inequalities, foster innovations and create positive atmosphere. There are a total of 23 elementary schools, 7 middle schools, 4 high schools, 11 schools serving grades K-8, 5 schools serving grades 6-12, and 4 specialty schools. The district is governed by the elected Board of Public Education of Pittsburgh. The City of Pittsburgh Controller and Treasurer serve dual roles in the School District of Pittsburgh.
For higher education there are countless and qualified options. The University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, Carlow University, Point Park University, and Carnegie Mellon University are just a few universities located in the City of Pittsburgh. There are even more just outside the city such as Robert Morris University, Washington & Jefferson, and La Roche College.

Right to Know Policy

On January 1, 2009, a new Right to Know Law (the "RTKL") took effect in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under this statute, public records of the City of Pittsburgh are generally available to citizens who request them.
The following outlines the basic provisions of the RTKL and the procedures for making a request for records:

I. PUBLIC RECORDS

The Right to Know Law defines a public record as information, regardless of physical form, which documents a transaction or activity of the City, and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the City. A record is NOT a public record if:
- it is exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b) of the RTKL; or
- it is exempt from disclosure under any other Federal of State law, or regulation or judicial order or decree; or
- it is protected by a privilege.
Generally, public records are to be open for inspection or duplication in accordance with the RTKL. Records are to be provided in the medium requested if they exist in that medium. Otherwise, they are to be provided in the medium in which they exist. The RTKL does not require the City to give computer access to any requester.
When responding to a request, the City is not required to create a record that does not presently exist. Nor is the City required to compile, maintain, format, or organize a record in a manner in which the City does not currently maintain, format, or organize the record.

II. MAKING A REQUEST

All Right to Know requests for information ("requests") must be submitted to the Open Records Officer ("ORO") of the City of Pittsburgh:
There are four ways to request a public record from the City: 1) In person; 2) By mail; 3) By e-mail; and 4) By fax. Requests may be verbal or written. However, if a verbal request is denied by the City, there is no right of appeal.
The Right to Know Law does not require the City to accept requests made by telephone, and the City will refuse to accept requests made by telephone. The Right to Know Law also does not require the City to accept anonymous requests, and the City will refuse to accept anonymous requests. For the purpose of this section, an e-mail request which does not contain a proper name or street address will be treated as an anonymous request.
In order to meet the requirements of the Right to Know Law, the request must:
- Identify the records requested with sufficient specificity to enable the City to ascertain which records are being requested; and
- Include the name of the requester; and
- Include the address to which the City should direct its response.
The request need not state the reason that the records are being requested.
The City has chosen to use the Standard Request Form promulgated by the Pennsylvania Open Records Office. This form may be downloaded from thewebsite of the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records. A hard-copy form may also be obtained from the City's ORO at the address above.
The City may deny "disruptive requests," which occur when a requester repeatedly requests the same record. However, the requester is not precluded from requesting a different record.

III. THE CITY'S RESPONSE TO A RIGHT TO KNOW REQUEST

Although individual City departments shall be required to expeditiously forward requests inadvertently sent to them instead of directly to the ORO, the time period for the City's response will begin to run as of the documented receipt of the request by the ORO. Requests received after 4:30 p.m. shall be deemed to be received on the next business day.
Upon receipt of a request by the Open Records Officer, the City will make a good faith effort to determine whether the record requested is a public record, and whether the City has custody of the record. The City will respond as rapidly as possible under the circumstances existing at the time of the request. However, the City will respond within five business days of the initial request. A "business day" shall be any weekday (Monday through Friday) except for official holiday closings or closings due to weather or natural disasters or due to the request of authorized public safety officials. Failure to respond within five business days will constitute a deemed denial of the request.
The RTKL does not require that the requester receive the City's response on the fifth business day. The City meets is obligations by mailing the response on the fifth business day.
The City will respond to each request in one of three ways:
- The City will grant the request in its entirety; or
- The City will deny the request; or
- The City will partially grant and partially deny the request.
There are circumstances set forth in the RTLK under which the City can take additional time to process a right to know request. The City is required to notify the requester in the "five day" letter which of these circumstances apply:
- The record must be redacted;
- The record must be retrieved from a remote location;
- A timely response is not possible due to bona fide and specified staffing limitations;
- A legal review is necessary to determine whether the record is a public record;
- The requester has not complied with the City's policies regarding access to records;
- The requester refuses to pay applicable fees;
- The extent or nature of the request precludes a response within the required time period.
If the City requires additional time to process a right to know request, it must nevertheless make its initial response within the five business day period. The letter will indicate which of the reasons justify the additional time, and will project a target date by which the records will be made available. The City cannot take more than thirty additional days without the written consent of the Requester. If such permission is not granted and the City takes more than thirty days from the expiration of the five business day period, the request will be deemed denied on the thirty-first day.
If the City denies a request for information (in whole or in part), it will issue a denial letter which will include:
- A description of the record being requested;
- The specific reasons for the denial, including a citation of supporting legal authority;
- The name, contact information, and signature of the Open Records Officer;
- The date of the request; and
- The procedure to appeal the denial of the request.

IV. FEES

The City may charge reasonable fees for copying as well as its actual costs for postage in fulfilling a Right to Know request.  These fees are posted on thePennsylvania Office of Open Records website.
If copying fees do not exceed five dollars, the copies and postage will be provided free of charge as a courtesy of the City of Pittsburgh.
If copying fees exceed five dollars, the fees and postage must be pre-paid before the records will be provided. The fee can be paid by check or money order payable to:
If the fees associated with a right to know request are anticipated to be greater than $100.00, the fees must be paid in advance before the City is obligated to compile the records.

V. APPEALS

The appeal must be made within fifteen business days of the City's denial or deemed denial, and must set forth the grounds on which the requester believes that the record is a public record, and the grounds for the denial by the City.
The Pennsylvania Office of Open Records will assign an appeals officer to the case, and the appeals officer will issue a decision within thirty days of the receipt of the appeal. The decision of the appeals officer may be appealed to the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.

VI. POLICIES

The City of Pittsburgh retains the discretion and authority to adopt any other written policies that are consistent with the Right to Know Law. Amendments to this policy will take effect upon publication on the City's website.

Accessibility Policy

The City of Pittsburgh is committed to providing access to our website for individuals with disabilities. The City recognizes the importance of making our website accessible by everyone, regardless of their abilities.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent the written information specified below.

The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible;

- nclude the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”;

A century ago women in this nation won their decades long fight for suffrage.
Rarely acknowledged for their integral part in the struggle for the vote, a feisty contingent of Pittsburgh women used their intelligence, wits and endurance to mount a fierce campaign against 
                                forces that employed all their might to deny them the vote.
Over and over again in Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh rose to the challenges, like a bright, glittering stars in the suffrage movement. Of particular note, the legislators of our Commonwealth were won 
                                over to the suffragists’ cause in no small measure due to the Pittsburgh Plan.
Yes the Pittsburgh Plan.It was a brilliant strategy conceived by Pittsburgh’s own Jennie Bradley Roessing, and implemented with the help of western PA suffragists and their active network across the Commonwealth. Their 
                                impact was felt across the nation.
Please take a moment to consider the era they lived in. Some were wealthy, some of modest means; part of the group was educated, others were barely literate; they were a diverse bunch, white and 
                                black women; Christian and Jewish women. These women hadn’t been raised to be:
- leaders speaking in front of hundreds of strangers
- fund raisers calling on wealthy, potential donors to ask for donations
- activists meeting with legislators, senators and governors
- strategists and communicators engaging and maintaining momentum among thousands, across Pennsylvania, without the benefit of today’s communication tools
But they did it.
Yes, at times their knees quaked under their spindly skirts. Yes, sometimes their voices sometimes quavered.
But they did it.
These pages are a starting point, we hope that you will explore more about Pittsburgh’s remarkable suffragists throughout this year.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Rights Regarding Your Information
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right, in accordance with applicable data protection laws, to make requests related to your “personal information” or “personal data” (as such terms are defined under applicable law, and collectively referred to herein as “personal information”).

Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you.

Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information and Processing/Sharing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base. Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt out of the disclosure of your personal information for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” or processing for purposes of targeted advertising, please visit "Your Privacy Choices" which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.
Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements.

If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying us that your copyrighted material has been infringed. We do not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. We may contact the notice provider to request additional information. Under the DMCA, we are required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content (“Alleged Infringer”).

The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Service. The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible;
- Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available);
- If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);
- Include the following statement: “I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”;
- nclude the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”;

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying us that your copyrighted material has been infringed. We do not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim.

Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Any person who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney.

A DMCA notice must:
- Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, “My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location where material is located].”);
- Identify the content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work. The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Service. The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible;
- Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available);
- If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);

- nclude the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”;

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and "Online Analytics and Advertising" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base.

Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.
Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.  Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.
Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting "Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Additional California Privacy Rights
In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light
California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us atprivacy@neogov.com.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do sohere.

Your Rights and Control under EU GDPR.

Data Controllers and Processors.
Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing.
Lawful Basis for Processing.
For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:
Consent.In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.
Legitimate Interest.We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.
Performance of a ContractWe process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.
Other Legal Bases.In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.
Automated Decision Making and Profiling.
We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Data Security and Integrity.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.
Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.
Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

Right to Revise.

We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to access and use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Policy.

Earned Income Tax - (Employer Withholding) is collected by Jordan Tax Service

WHAT IS TAXED?
Under Pennsylvania Earned Income Tax law, all residents of the City of Pittsburgh must have three (3%) percent of their wages withheld from their pay as Earned Income Tax. This amount is to be remitted to Jordan Tax Services. This applies whether the employer is located within or outside the City of Pittsburgh. The determining factor is the residency of the employee, not the location of the employer.
If insufficient amounts are withheld by employers, City residents are required to pay the difference when EIT tax returns are filed with Jordan Tax Services. Jordan Tax Services is the agent for EIT Tax collection for the Allegheny County Central Tax District.
TAX RATE:City of Pittsburgh residential; City 1%, School district 2%.3% Total
Jordan Tax Services can be contacted at 412-345-7966 orjts@jordantax.com.
DUE DATE:The last day of the second month after quarter end for the prior quarters’ activity.
TAX RATE: 5½ Mills (.0055) or .55%
WHO PAYS THE TAX?
All persons who engage, hire, employ, or contract with one or more individuals, as employees, to perform work or render services within the City of Pittsburgh. The Payroll Tax is computed on the employer’s total payroll expense (total compensation) associated with business activity in the City.  Partners are considered employees of the employer for purposes of the Payroll Tax.  You do not need to be located in the City of Pittsburgh to be subject to this tax.

DO SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS AND PARTNERS HAVE TO PAY THE TAX?
Yes, self-employed persons and partners in a partnership, if the partnership otherwise does not remit the tax, must file the tax return and remit the tax on their own earnings. In calculating the earnings of self-employed persons or partners, such earnings are the sum of guaranteed payments and the lesser of net profits or net draws or distributions from the business. Passive income received by a self-employed person or a partner is not subject to tax because it is not considered “earned” income.

IMPORTANT DATES
Employers must file quarterly reports with the City Treasurer on or before the last day of the second month after the quarter, reporting the preceding quarter’s activity on the Payroll Expense Tax Form provided athttps://pittsburghpa.gov/finance/tax-forms. Thus, 1st Quarter taxes and reports are due May 31st, 2nd Quarter; taxes and reports are due August 31st, 3rd Quarter taxes and reports are due November 30th, and 4th Quarter taxes and reports are due February 28th of the following year.

TAX RATES, PENALTIES, AND FEES
How much is it?
The Payroll Tax is fifty-five hundredths of a percent (.55% or .0055) of payroll expense generated as a result of an employer conducting business within the City of Pittsburgh, collected quarterly.
What is taxed?
Payroll expense, which is the total compensation paid, including salaries, wages, net distributions, commissions, bonuses, stock options and other compensation to all individuals who during any tax year, perform work or render services in whole or in part in the City of Pittsburgh.
For more information, see:
- Payroll Expense Tax Regulations athttps://pittsburghpa.gov/finance/tax-forms
- Payroll Expense Tax FAQs athttps://pittsburghpa.gov/finance/tax-faqs
What if my employees don’t just work in the City of Pittsburgh?
For employers whose employees perform work or render services partly within and partly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, the method of computing their payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh is to use the percentage of total number of working hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of hours employed (within and outside) the City for each individual employee.  Detailed examples are provided in the Regulations.
What happens if you don’t pay on time?
If an employer does not pay on time, interest and penalties will be added to the amount it owes.

Yes.  Employers must discontinue withholding the Local Services Tax when (i) the total earned income from all sources within the City of Pittsburgh is less than $12,000; (ii) the employee is on active duty in the military; or (iii) the employee is an honorably discharged veteran of the armed forces with a 100% service-connected-disability.  In order to receive an exemption from the Local Services Tax, the employee must file an exemption certificate with their employer which can be found at the “Local Services Tax Exemption Certificate” link athttps://pittsburghpa.gov/finance/tax-forms

What happens if the employee changes job locations during the year or works outside the City?
The employer is supposed to withhold the Local Services Tax for the municipality associated with the principal work location of the employee.  For example, if the employee has $10 in Local Services Tax withheld for Municipality “A” and changes her job location to the City in the same calendar year, then the employee must provide the employer an exemption certificate.  Having received the timely filed exemption certificate, the employer only has to withhold $42 ($52 less $10 paid to Municipality “A”) in City Local Services Tax from the employee.

What happens if the employee changes his employer during the year?
The employee is supposed to provide the employer an exemption certificate showing how much Local Services Tax has been withheld during the current year.  No more than $52 in Local Services Tax can be withheld by all employers from a particular employee.

                            remove sole financial burden from the City of Pittsburgh for regional attractions, in RAD’s
                            nearly 28 years of public support, the five regional parks have received over $150 million
                            in operating and capital grants. RAD is proud to play such a significant role in ensuring

                            our regional parks are safe and vibrant places for our communities to gather, explore, and
                            be inspired. Learn more:https:

Achieving Our Goals for Students

Advancing positive student outcomes and experiences is a multi-faceted effort that requires the collaboration of the entire Pittsburgh community. These efforts are coordinated through a series of deliberate plans, each working in tandem to help us achieve our goals for students and ensure excellence, equity, and efficiency.

Strategic Plan

We are proud to announce Pittsburgh Public Schools' new strategic plan,Students First Always, in All Ways: A Five-Year Strategic Plan to Drive Student Outcomes and Experiences. We developed our strategic plan with the invaluable input or our community and a thorough analysis of District data. Our plan is designed to achieve six priority outcomes that will guide our efforts over the next five years, ensuring the best possible education and support for all our students.

Facilities Utilization Plan

Pittsburgh is changing, and Pittsburgh Public Schools must be flexible and thoughtful in its approach to align and advance student learning and experiences. By making smart moves now, we can offer equitable opportunities to all students and utilize our resources effectively. Working together as one District, not as separate schools or communities, we can transform education. There will be tough decisions ahead, but our common goal is to provide the best for our children. Learn more about how you can provide input on portfolio design in PPS.

Equity

For more than three decades, Pittsburgh Public Schools has been working attentively towards building racial equity. We work with the community-appointed Equity Advisory Panel to embed recommendations that support equity through unrelenting advocacy.  Together we strive to move the needle on equity develop tools to encourage cross-functional supports that convert to frameworks for educational improvement and transformation.
