River access is highly valued in Pittsburgh. We maintain approximately 51 acres of riverfront parks. Many partner organizations such as the 
					Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Sports & Exhibition Authority also maintain signature public riverfront properties.
Our riverfronts also feature a significant public trail system along the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio riverfronts.

Rec2Tech
The Office of the MayorÂ began the conversation of connecting kidsÂ of all colors in the urban community to 21st Century tech skill sets.Â  By providing a safe space in their community to foster those skills we at CitiParks look forward to fulfilling this mission through our Rec2Tech programming.
Rec2Tech will demonstrate how we can use existing city resources to increase access to technology for; and provide young people with the 21st Century learning opportunities they will need to succeed in innovation and technology fields. Ultimately, Rec2Tech will help bridge the divide and provide access to opportunities for people in their own neighborhood and community.
One of the ways in which CitiParks has been able to get our Rec2Tech Program started is through an award from the National Science Foundation.Â With this funding,Citiparks has teamed up with Baltimore City and the Digital Harbor Foundationto addressÂ the digital divide through innovative Rec2Tech programming.

Introduction; Scope of this Policy.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the âPolicyâ) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA âNEOGOVâ), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the âServicesâ), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as âGovernmentjobsâ, "Schooljobs", âNEOGOVâ, âNEOEDâ, âPowerDMSâ, âweâ, âusâ, or âourâ).
By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into ourTerms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in theTerms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to theTerms of Useand this Policy, including limitations on liability.
This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the âDe-Identified Platform Dataâ). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.  Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion.
We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the âWhere We Are a Service Providerâ section below.

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a "data processor" or "service provider" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.  Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you.
For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customerâs privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.
Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.

In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.
Information Provided by You.
We collect personal data from you directly when you visit our Services from either your computer, mobile phone, or other device, attend one our events, or communicate with our personnel. The categories of personal data we collect from you, involve the following:

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:
- A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either âpersistentâ cookies or âsessionâ cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
- A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.
- HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox, orApple Safari).

MOBILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE

PRESS RELEASES
Provide the physical mobility necessary to support the social and economic mobility of the people of Pittsburgh through the management, design, improvement, and operation of the public right of way.
What we do.
The Department is responsible for the transportation of people and goods throughout the City of Pittsburgh, and for managing the operation of and access to the public right-of-way (the sidewalks, curbs, streets, and bridges that make up our network).
City's Mobility Principles:
- No one dies or is seriously injured traveling on city streets.
- Every household in Pittsburgh can access fresh fruits and vegetables within 20 minutes travel of home, without the requirement of a private vehicle.
- All trips less than 1 mile are easily and enjoyably achieved by non-vehicle travel.
- No household must spend more than 45% of household income to satisfy basic housing, transportation and energy needs.
- The design, maintenance and operation of city streets reflects the values of our community.
Research finds that access to transportation is the factor most likely to influence household economic success (https://www.planetizen.com/node/76552). With this in mind, the mission of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is to provide the transportation mobility essential to the economic mobility of all Pittsburghers.

New Permit Management System Launch!

Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) will be launching a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system comes a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process will allow event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants would need to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants can secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they have a secure venue and dates.
Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the âGetting Started: Event Permitsâ for information on the entire permitting process!

New Features with Eproval!

In addition to being able to secure their event venue prior to completing all event-specific details, Eproval provides several new exciting features that will make the event permitting process more streamlined for applicants. Among them:
- Scalable Application:During Phase Two of the application, applicants will be asked a series of yes/no questions up front, such as but not limited to: âwill your event have a stage?â and âwill you be having fireworks?â This allows the system to custom build an application specific to that event. If the event takes place in a park and does not impact any roadways, the applicant will not be presented with questions about road closures. If an event will not have fireworks, the applicant will not have to answer any questions about fireworks. This will minimize the length of the application for small community events, while larger more complex events will require more information.
- Public Event Calendar:During the application process, applicants will be given the opportunity to opt-in to our brand new public event calendar. This will be a forward facing calendar that will list all pending and approved event applications. Applicants who opt into being on the calendar can provide contact info and website information, as well as a quick two to three sentence marketing pitch. This calendar will be available on the Cityâs website for anyone to find when looking for things to do in the City.
For general information and guidance, please reach out to the Office of Film & Event Management at the contact info below.

About Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh was founded on November 27, 1758. The city was named byGeneral John Forbes, in honor ofÂ BritishÂ statesmanWilliam Pitt, the 1st Earl of Chatham.Â Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in our countryâs history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the âGateway to the West.â This nickname referenced the huge advantage Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is known as the âpointâ to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for products such as coal, timber, glass,Â natural gas, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nationâs steel. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - âThe Smoky City."
Throughout the years, Pittsburgh has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has moved from the steel industry to become a leader inÂ healthcare, education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily polluted streets andÂ riverfronts, have been transformed to createÂ the modern vibrant Pittsburgh one sees today.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the sixth largest populated state in the United States. Pittsburgh is the second largest city in Pennsylvania and has an estimated of 310,000 people. The population consists of 51.9% females and 48.9% males, with the average age being 33. Pittsburgh, serves as the County Seat of Allegheny County which has an estimatedÂ populationÂ of 1.2 million. Pittsburgh serves as the principal city of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area, or Greater Pittsburgh. This 8 county area has an estimated population of 2.6 million.
The City of Pittsburgh offers everything a person might be looking for in a home, with its wonderful shopping areas, great restaurants, and beautiful views. Pittsburgh is known for having more named neighborhoods than any American city. Ninety distinct communitiesÂ collectivelyÂ create the culture of Pittsburgh.Â The Strip District is a wonderful market spot known for its variety of food and an excellent shopping with unique stores. The neighborhoods known as Shadyside, Beechview, or the West End areÂ other fantastic region of Pittsburgh to find trendy shops and restaurants. If youâre looking for authentic homemade Italian food, Bloomfield or âPittsburghâs Little Italyâ is the place for you. If youâre looking for more of a creative and artistic side of Pittsburgh, pass through the neighborhood of Lawrenceville.
East Liberty is known as for business and industries. Looking for a fun night out on the town? South Side has a fun and exciting nightlife full of clubs, sports bars, and laid-back pubs. Wanting to catch a game or spend some quality time with your loved ones? The North Shore or North Side is the place to be. MountÂ Washington is the high point of Pittsburgh; it gives the residents of Pittsburgh and tourists a beautiful view of this magnificent city. Finally, Downtown, like most downtown districts, has great food, dining, parks, plazas, and art museums.
Pittsburgh Public Schools strives to accelerate student achievement, eliminate racial inequalities, foster innovations and create positive atmosphere. There are a total of 23 elementary schools, 7 middle schools, 4 high schools, 11 schools serving grades K-8, 5 schools serving grades 6-12, and 4 specialty schools. The district is governed by the elected Board of Public Education of Pittsburgh. The City of Pittsburgh Controller and Treasurer serve dual roles in the School District of Pittsburgh.
For higher education there are countless and qualified options. The University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, Carlow University, Point Park University, and Carnegie Mellon University are just a few universities located in the City of Pittsburgh. There are even more just outside the city such as Robert Morris University, Washington & Jefferson, and La Roche College.

In 1794, the newly formed Borough of Pittsburgh established a Public Market House in the current location of Market Square. Aside from creating 
the public market tradition that continues there today, this location was also home to the very first Pittsburgh Municipal Hall. As Pittsburgh 
continued to grow, so would the space required for government services. The Market House quickly became obsolete and the cornerstone of a new 
City Hall was laid at Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue in May of 1869. The County, which first courthouse was also in this location moved 
to its current location on Grant Street in 1836. The Smithield Street City Hall would serve until the completion of the City-County Building 
in 1917. It would sit abandoned for 50 years before sold for a redevelopment in the 1950's.

The second City Hall on Smithfield Street.
Mayor David Lawrence strikes the first blow for the demolition of the second City Hall.
In 1911, a City of Pittsburgh Commission was formed by unanimous resolution of Council for the construction of a new City Hall. The Commission, 
which by 1913 had been joined by the appropriate members representing Allegheny County, employed New York architect Cass Gilbert to arrange a 
competition for the design of a new municipal building. Of the 16 entries, the winning design was submitted by the firm Palmer, Hornbostel, & 
Jones of New York, who were represented locally by Edward B. Lee. The plans were officially adopted on January 19, 1914, and began the 
following year. The building acted as a gift to Pittsburgh to honor the 1916 Centennial of Pittsburgh's 1816 incorporation as a City. At the 
March 1916 dedication ceremony, Mayor Joseph Armstrong placed a time capsule into the still under construction building. Two and a half years 
later in December 1917, he would become the first Mayor to call the City-County Building a second home. The missing time capsule has yet to be discovered.

The Grand Lobby of the City-County Building, is one of the building's most beautiful spaces. The room extends the length of the building, 
connecting Grant Street to Ross Street. The 30-foot wide hall is topped off by a 47-foot high barrel-vaulted ceiling. On the first floor, the 
marble lined hall is flanked by a series of row offices that contain the public service offices most often visited - the County's marriage 
license and passports, and Pittsburgh's Controller, and Treasury offices. The offices form a base on which sit the bronze classical columns 
that support the vaulted ceiling. The columns are works of art themselves, manufactured by Louis Tiffany Studios. They feature, in a rotating 
series at their bases, the Seals of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, as well as iconic local frontiersman Guyasuta and Pittsburgh's oldest 
surviving building, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse. The rooms ornate elevator doors feature a series of reliefs detailing the previous homes of 
municipal government. The reliefs age with the building's they clutch, reaching adulthood with the present City-County Building and Allegheny 
County Courthouse.

The offical statue of Sir William Pitt was a gift to Pittsburgh from Sir Charles Wakefield Baronet, the former Lord Mayor of London in 1922.
The place where much of Pittsburgh's future was shaped, the Office of the Mayor, has played the role of a second home to every Cheif Executive 
of Pittsburgh since 1917. These two state rooms have gone virtually unchanged in the last century. Most of the furniture, including the iconic Desk, are 
original to the building's opening and were custom designed by Hornbostel.

the room also carries a historical record. The ornate plaster ceiling details the names of the municipalities which have been annexed in 
making up present day Pittsburgh. It also features the names of Pittsburgh's past Mayors. Having since outgrown the ceiling, many names now expand to the rooms 
hand-painted canvas walls. The room is completed with detailed walnut wainscoting which features the beautiful inlaid Pittsburgh Crest.

As home to both the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County offices, the upper floors of the City-County Building are home to a large part of 
the courts system. The most famous tenant being the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Supreme Court splits its time 
between the state's three major areas, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and the State Capitol, Harrisburg. The ornate plaster ceiling features murals 
of 3 major historical law givers: Justinian - representing Roman law, Moses - for Judaic law, & King Edward representing English law. In 
addition it includes the dates of the completion of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Its hand painted canvas walls feature 
large murals of William Penn, the namesake of the Commonwealth, and William Pitt, the namesake of Pittsburgh, as well as the portraits of 
Supreme Court Justices from the Western District. The room is completed with mahogany wainscoting and furniture.

At first glance,Burghâs Eye View might seem like someÂ­thing from the dreams of our most ânebÂ­byâ neighÂ­bors. For the first time, you can easiÂ­ly see all kinds of data about PittsÂ­burghâincludÂ­ing 311 reÂ­quests, buildÂ­ing permits, code violatÂ­ions, pubÂ­lic safeÂ­ty inÂ­ciÂ­dents, city assets, and public records on every parÂ­cel in the city.
But City data isnât a log of when and where we put our parkÂ­ing chairs. Itâs a huge colÂ­lectÂ­ion of inÂ­formÂ­ation about the world aÂ­round us that can help us underÂ­stand whatâs happenÂ­ing in our neighÂ­borÂ­hoods, and lead us to ideas and decisÂ­ions that can make where we live betÂ­ter. We think of it as nebÂ­by for the greatÂ­er good.
So, whether youâre lookÂ­ing at inÂ­formÂ­atÂ­ion about sideÂ­walks that need reÂ­pairÂ­ing, or mapÂ­ping out streetÂ­lights that are a litÂ­tle too dim, reÂ­memÂ­ber: While data can help us know, its highÂ­est purÂ­pose is to help us join toÂ­getÂ­her with other reÂ­sidÂ­ents and the City to make change.

Ok, so how do I use it?

Burghâs Eye View uses maps to visualize data generated by the City of Pittsburgh and its residents. As you play with itâchanging the date range, for exampleâwhat you see on the map will change. You can scroll to zoom or use the +/- buttons at the top left, click on pins to see details, and move the map around using a mouse or touch.
Currently, three general map types are available: maps of points, places and parcels.
The points map shows data located at specific points in the city, such as public safety incidents, 311 requests, code violations, capital projects, and city assets.
Also, if you like videos, check out these how-tos produced by our Cable Channel:
- Introduction and Overview
- Use Case: Public Safety
- Downloading Data
The Places map allows you to view a wide range of City assets, including bridges and recreation space, steps, pools, historic districts, flood zones, traffic signals, and more.
The Parcels map allows you to view, at the neighborhood level, delinquent properties, City-owned properties, and properties in a tax abatement program. You can also view information about any specific parcel, including type of owner, property class, sale information, county land value, and potential liens. Some information, including the ownerâs name, is not included in order to protect people's privacy. While data on properties that are tax delinquent, in a tax abatement program, or city-owned comes from the City of Pittsburgh, all other data on the Parcels maps comes our partners at Allegheny County.

Wait, why are things where they are?

Markers or âpinsâ for each dataset show up on the map differently depending on the source. Public Safety pins are geocoded by the block or intersection of the incident or arrest using Allegheny County's geocoder, every night. Code violations are geocoded at the center of their respective parcel, which is determined by Allegheny County. 311 Requests are first geocoded by the City's 311 request tracking system. To maintain citizens' privacy these requests are then specially obfuscated. This process is handled by theWestern Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, and they describe it this way:

Wow, is there more like this?

Whenever possible, Burghâs Eye View will point you to other resources for the data or information you are viewing. This includes links to theAllegheny County Real Estate Portal, the311 Request Online Form, and theCity Online Facility Rentalpage. All of these resources are available 24/7, just like Burghâs Eye View.
This page has lots of links to other City data, information and resources, and you can find more atpittsburghpa.govor by following the city onTwitterandFacebook.
And yes there are more projects like this to come! You can write to the team that built this atanalytics@pittsburghpa.gov. We'd love to hear your feedback, ideas, and hopes for the future of data in the City of Pittsburgh. (But please note that we may not be able to respond individually.)
Burghâs Eye View is an initiative of theDepartment of the Innovation & Performanceâs Analytics & Strategy Team. We work under the vision and leadership of Mayor Bill Peduto, who has from day one been committed to being transparent and open with City data.

What is the Snow Angels Program?

Helping your neighbors is SNOW much fun!
Snow-covered sidewalks can be hazardous for everyone. The City of Pittsburghâs Snow Angels Program pairs older residents and residents with disabilities with nearby neighbors who volunteer to assist them with snow removal on their sidewalks and walkways.
Along with fostering stronger community relationships and relieving some of the stress that comes from a snowfall or freeze, Snow Angels make our sidewalks safer for those who are outside during the winter weather, like postal carriers, firefighters, police officers, and other neighbors.
In 2023, we encouraged couches, faith-based and community leaders to sign up their groups as Snow Angels to support their neighbors in need.

Requirements for Snow Angel Recipients

We are not accepting applications for Snow Angel service at this time.Follow this page, or leave your contact information in the form above to be notified when the program reopens for the 2024-2025 season.

If youâd like a neighbor to come help break the ice!
Here are the requirements neighbors must meet to request a Snow Angel:
Be at least 62 years old, or have a physical disability.
Live within the City of Pittsburgh.Click hereto find out if you live within city limits.
Do not have resources (financial or family and friends nearby) to assist with snow removal.
Things to know before signing up:
- You are not guaranteed assistance. Service depends on if thereâs a Snow Angel who has signed up to volunteer near you. Our staff works closely with the community to do the best volunteer recruitment and outreach we can, but we cannot guarantee you will be matched.
- If you are matched with a volunteer, we will notify you by email or phone call. Registration is on a rolling basis, so a Snow Angel may be available later in the season. We will contact you when you have a match.
- You may not receive immediate help during a snowfall. Please give your volunteer a reasonable amount of time to assist you - we recommend allowing 24-hours after a snow event concludes. Your Snow Angel may have work, family, or personal matters that prevent them from immediately shoveling and salting your sidewalk or walkway.
- You do not have to be home when a volunteer arrives to help.

Volunteer FAQ

- We will contact volunteers via email with confirmation details when they have been assigned a neighbor.
- Volunteers and recipients may not be assigned immediately. Neighbors request help throughout the winter season. Volunteers may be assigned immediately, a few weeks after signing up, or later during the winter.
- Volunteer assignments depend on if a neighbor nearby needs help. If no neighbors sign up, we may not be able to assign volunteers. Either way, we will keep in touch!
- We ask that volunteers help out neighbors as soon as they are able, and within 24-hours of the end of a snow event.
- If volunteers are willing to help shovel and salt for more than one neighbor, please let us know on the sign-up form. We'll do our best to match you with another nearby neighbor.

Recipient FAQ

- Volunteers and recipients may not be assigned immediately, but we'll let both parties know when they have been assigned.
- We ask that volunteers help out neighbors as soon as they are able, and within 24-hours of the end of a snow event.

=section name="Snow Plow Tracker"
Snow Plow Tracker App v.2.0

What does the Plow Tracker 2.0 show me?
The Plow Tracker v 2.0 displays the history trail of Public Works vehicles conducting deicing and/or anti-icing and plowing operations. Vehicle travel on City streets is displayed with a pink history trail.
Street treatment efforts can be tracked within the last 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours by selecting the desired interval below the map.
Roads are color-coded to show the Cityâs treatment responsibilities.

=== Table ===
City Treatment Responsibility:    
White â City (City Responsibility)
=== End of Table ===

=== Table ===
Other Treatment Responsibility:         
Light Blue: City (County Responsibility)
Yellow â State (State Responsibility)   
Green â County (County responsibility)  
Lilac â Private
=== End of Table ===
Where are the trucks treating the cityâs streets?
Current vehicle location is displayed with a vehicle icon on the screen on the âNowâ and 2, 4, 12, and 24 interval time displays.
The Plow Tracker v 2.0 does not display the current location of vehicles traveling slower than 2.5 m.p.h., or if the ignition is off. To ensure drivers are able to treat the roads without interruption, vehicle icons are presented with a time delay.
How can I navigate to my street?
Users of the Plow Tracker 2.0 can zoom in on the map to view their street or select their street from the drop-down menu located below the history display buttons.
What does treatment mean?
Treatment is the application of anti-icing (before snow and ice arrive) and / or deicing (after snow / ice have fallen) materials. While their application indicates that the street has been treated it does not indicate that a street will be clear of any snow/ ice â that will happen when the temperatures are favorable (rising, not falling), the sun is prevalent and pedestrians and vehicles work the deicing and/or anti-icing material.
Primary and secondary streets are treated simultaneously but during heavy snow or changing weather conditions Public Works vehicles may return to treating only primaries prior to returning to secondary and tertiary routes. The streets are categorized based on traffic volume.
Who owns/maintains the street?
In addition to City streets, Public Works conducts deicing and/or anti-icing operations on certain Allegheny County, and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania roads.
Later this winter weather season we will update the Plow Tracker map to display city snow and ice treatment responsibility.
Why do trucks go on streets that the city does not own or maintain?
There are times that Public Works vehicles travel on streets they do not own or maintain:
- To efficiently connect to streets the city treats.
- To return to Public Works Division maintenance garages.
- To load more deicing and/or anti-icing materials.
Why did the truck go halfway up the street and turn around?
To apply deicing and/or anti-icing materials to streets during a winter weather event Public Works drivers may turn their vehicle around and back up steep hills because this is the most efficient and safest manner to treat the street. In other instances, drivers may encounter difficulty accessing narrow streets when cars are parked too far into the roadway. In such cases, the driver has to return in the hope the vehicle has moved or return with a smaller piece of equipment.
Why is my de-icing material blue?
For the 2018-19 winter weather season, Public Works is treating roads with a new rock salt made of Magnesium Chloride instead of Sodium Chloride treated with liquid Calcium Chloride. Magnesium Chloride is expected to have a lower melting point and better deicing capabilities, particularly at lower temperatures. Our new deicing material is treated with a blue pigment that enables residents and drivers to be better able to determine if the street has recently been treated.
How can I help Public Works treat my street?
When driving:
- Donât drive if you donât have to!
- If you can delay your trip to allow our crews to get deicing and/or anti-icing materials down please do so.
- If you do, give the plow operators space to operate.
When parking:
- Donât park your car on a corner.
- If you have the ability to move your car off the street, we encourage you to do so.
- Donât park your car too far in the street.
When shoveling:
- Donât shovel your snow into your street.
- Donât clear your car into the street; clear it before youâre driving.
Please be patient and give our crews the time needed to treat over 1,200 miles of streets.
What are the snow levels and what do they mean?
Public Works classifies storm conditions into Levels, which determine the required response for a given winter weather event. Based on the Levels, residents and drivers can expect that all streets will be treated in the following manner. Know that while there are periods when it is not snowing, that does not mean the weather event has ended.
Level 0: No service response required.
Level 1:
- 0.5" - 3" forecasted snow or ice
- Standard deployment of snow removal resources
- Salting/plowing as needed
- Large equipment assigned to primary routes
- Small equipment assigned to secondary routes
Level 2:
- 3" - 6" forecasted snow or ice
- Salting/plowing as needed
- Emphasis on primary routes
- Small equipment assigned to secondary routes
- All DPW vehicles and equipment put into plow mode
- Recommend that resident vehicles be moved from side streets and alleys
Level 3:
- 6" - 10" forecasted snow or ice
- Salting/plowing as needed
- Heavy emphasis on emergency routes and primary routes; secondary and tertiary routes follow accordingly
- All DPW vehicles and equipment put into plow mode
- Parking restrictions enforcedÂ (Citations may be issued to vehicles that pose a danger or impede snow removal efforts.)
Level 4:
- 10+" forecasted snow or ice
- Full deployment of snow removal resources
- Primary focus on emergency routes, with primary, secondary and tertiary following accordingly
- Parking restrictions enforced (Citations may be issued to vehicles that pose a danger or impede snow removal efforts.)
- Use of pre-qualified contractors activated as needed

=section name="Film & Event Permits"

Welcome to the Office of Film & Event Management

The Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) is the official permitting authority for block parties, special events, first amendment activity, and film projects in the City of Pittsburgh. To support the cityâs rapidly growing event & film industry, the Office of Film & Event Management has streamlined the permitting process for event organizers and film producers via efficient digital permitting. In addition to streamlining the permitting process for events & film projects in the City of Pittsburgh, the Office of Film & Event Management will also be responsible for the following:
OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh as well as consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met. Via the Special Events Committee, OFEM also works with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of all events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the Cityâs operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents.
- Issuing permits to events and productions filming on public property in the City of Pittsburgh.
- Facilitating communication between event organizers, film producers, and city departments and authorities.
- Handling cost recovery efforts for City services related to event & film needs.
- Handling permitting for block-parties and community festivals in addition to special events and films.
- Consulting on major and minor civic events within the City.

New Permit Management System Launch!

Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) will be launching a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system comes a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process will allow event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants would need to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants can secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they have a secure venue and dates.
Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the âGetting Started: Event Permitsâ for information on the entire permitting process!

New Features with Eproval!

In addition to being able to secure their event venue prior to completing all event-specific details, Eproval provides several new exciting features that will make the event permitting process more streamlined for applicants. Among them:
- Scalable Application:During Phase Two of the application, applicants will be asked a series of yes/no questions up front, such as but not limited to: âwill your event have a stage?â and âwill you be having fireworks?â This allows the system to custom build an application specific to that event. If the event takes place in a park and does not impact any roadways, the applicant will not be presented with questions about road closures. If an event will not have fireworks, the applicant will not have to answer any questions about fireworks. This will minimize the length of the application for small community events, while larger more complex events will require more information.
- Public Event Calendar:During the application process, applicants will be given the opportunity to opt-in to our brand new public event calendar. This will be a forward facing calendar that will list all pending and approved event applications. Applicants who opt into being on the calendar can provide contact info and website information, as well as a quick two to three sentence marketing pitch. This calendar will be available on the Cityâs website for anyone to find when looking for things to do in the City.
For general information and guidance, please reach out to the Office of Film & Event Management at the contact info below.

About Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh was founded on November 27, 1758. The city was named byGeneral John Forbes, in honor ofÂ BritishÂ statesmanWilliam Pitt, the 1st Earl of Chatham.Â Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in our countryâs history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the âGateway to the West.â This nickname referenced the huge advantage Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is known as the âpointâ to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for products such as coal, timber, glass,Â natural gas, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nationâs steel. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - âThe Smoky City."
Throughout the years, Pittsburgh has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has moved from the steel industry to become a leader inÂ healthcare, education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily polluted streets andÂ riverfronts, have been transformed to createÂ the modern vibrant Pittsburgh one sees today.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the sixth largest populated state in the United States. Pittsburgh is the second largest city in Pennsylvania and has an estimated of 310,000 people. The population consists of 51.9% females and 48.9% males, with the average age being 33. Pittsburgh, serves as the County Seat of Allegheny County which has an estimatedÂ populationÂ of 1.2 million. Pittsburgh serves as the principal city of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area, or Greater Pittsburgh. This 8 county area has an estimated population of 2.6 million.
The City of Pittsburgh offers everything a person might be looking for in a home, with its wonderful shopping areas, great restaurants, and beautiful views. Pittsburgh is known for having more named neighborhoods than any American city. Ninety distinct communitiesÂ collectivelyÂ create the culture of Pittsburgh.Â The Strip District is a wonderful market spot known for its variety of food and an excellent shopping with unique stores.

In calculating the earnings of self-employed persons or partners, such earnings are the sum of guaranteed payments and the lesser of net profits or net draws or distributions from the business. Passive income received by a self-employed person or a partner is not subject to tax because it is not considered âearnedâ income.
