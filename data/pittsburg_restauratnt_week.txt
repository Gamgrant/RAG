Winter 2025: Monday January 13 to Sunday January 19
Early Access Weekend: Friday, January 10 to Sunday, January 12
Annual Winter Theme: “New Dishes for the New Year”
FAQ: How does restaurant week work?
Browse Menus. Make Reservations. Dine Out. Enjoy.
No coupons required. Mention PRW to your host/server to ensure you are getting the entire restaurant week experience.

List of restaurants coming in early November.

Pricing:
With such a wide variety of establishments participating, a one-size-fits all pricing model doesn’t make sense, so Pittsburgh Restaurant Week has themed pricing of “24-cents” for 2024. All special menus should follow that pricing model. Common pricing options include:

Fixed-price 3-course meal for $20.24-45.24.  This variable price point allows restaurants to price their menus’ accordingly. Menu items do not have to come from the restaurant’s regular menu, but should be representative of the restaurant’s style of cooking. As an example, restaurants whose normal ﬁxed price menu is above $35, create a special menu for Restaurant Week for $35.24.
$20.24 Specialty Items in honor of Restaurant Week 2024. This could be a specialty entrée, appetizer-entrée combination or even stretched to “Dinner for Two” depending on the pricing structure that best fits the restaurant.
