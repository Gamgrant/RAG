Los Pittsburgh Steelers derrotaron 20-10 a los Chargers en el primer partido de la temporada en Acrisure Stadium y mantienen el invicto y el liderato de la DivisiÃ³n Norte de la Conferencia Americana despuÃ©s de 3 semanas de temporada regular.
Como lo hablamos en la previa, el partido serÃ­a un duelo de fuerzas defensivas y vaya que la defensiva de los Steelers respondiÃ³, especialmente en la segunda mitad del partido. La ofensiva jugÃ³ el que probablemente ha sido el mejor de los tres partidos de la temporada 2024, Justin Fields se vio muy bien lanzando el balÃ³n y resolviendo escenarios en momentos clave.
"Me gustÃ³ el desempeÃ±o del equipo, no fue el partido mÃ¡s fluido, pero no sentÃ­ falta de compromiso de los jugadores por la meta que tenÃ­amos trazada. Los jugadores aceptaron el reto y creo que es algo que tenemos que seguir haciendo en el futuro", fueron las palabras de Mike Tomlin tras el partido.
La primera mitad del partido fue sumamente pareja, ambos quarterbacks Fields y Herbert estaban sufriendo contra las defensivas, especialmente tratando de establecer el juego terrestre. Ambos tuvieron una buena racha de pases completos pero no fue hasta la segunda mitad donde se marcÃ³ la diferencia real.
Justin Herbert saliÃ³ lastimado del partido, Taylor Heinecke tomÃ³ su lugar y desde ese momento la defensiva de los Steelers se dio un festÃ­n, en total durante el partido la unidad concretÃ³ 5 capturas, dos de ellas de Nick Herbig, quiÃ©n entrÃ³ por la lesiÃ³n en la ingle de Alex Highsmith, una de Cam Heyward, otra de Elandon Roberts y obviamente una mÃ¡s para el triturador, T.J. Watt.
La defensiva de los Pittsburgh Steelers ha dejado en 10 puntos o menos a sus tres rivales en la actual temporada, algo que no se veÃ­a en la NFL desde el 2009 con los Denver Broncos.
Del lado ofensivo del balÃ³n Justin Fields tuvo un gran partido en el que conectÃ³ 25-32 intentos de pase para 245 yardas para un touchdown y una intercepciÃ³n. Nuestro quarterback tambiÃ©n corriÃ³ para otra anotaciÃ³n y el resto de los puntos cayeron con dos goles de campo del Mago de Boz, Chris Boswell.
La jugada a destacar fue el extraordinario pase de Fields a Calvin Austin III de 55 yardas que terminÃ³ en anotaciÃ³n para los Steelers, fue un muy buen partido para el receptor de Pittsburgh, quien sumÃ³ 4 recepciones para 95 yardas.
Hay que resaltar el cambio que tuvo la ofensiva de Pittsburgh cuando el novato Mason McCormick hizo su debut en la NFL y entrÃ³ en lugar de Spencer Anderson como guardia izquierdo en la lÃ­nea ofensiva. El desempeÃ±o en las trincheras mejorÃ³.
El siguiente partido serÃ¡ en IndianÃ¡polis contra los Colts el domingo 29 de septiembre a las 11am, hora del centro de MÃ©xico. Durante la semana analizaremos ese partido. Disfrutemos la victoria y el increÃ­ble arranque de los Steelers.
