Free admission to Treasured Ornament is available for Allegheny County Library Card holders through The Allegheny County Regional Asset District's RAD Pass program at RadPass.org.
Make art with Khadijat Yussuff (they/them), a Pittsburgh-based interdisciplinary artist and arts educator raised between Abeokuta, Nigeria and The Bronx, New York! Khadijat is currently working as the Frick’s inaugural Artist Educator in Residence.
They are developing a unique workshop that incorporates the themes and objects of the Treasured Ornament exhibition. Participants will enjoy a walk through the exhibit for insight and ideas before creating their own works inspired by the collection.
New and experienced artists will work with the Frick’s teaching artists during monthly hands-on workshops. Each session includes wine, light bites, and all materials needed for the art activity. Buy a bundled ticket and come with a friend, or come solo and make some new ones!
