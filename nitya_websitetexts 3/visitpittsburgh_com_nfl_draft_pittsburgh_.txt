Welcome to Pittsburgh, where mighty bridges stand for strength, progress and innovation. Where three rivers meet in a golden triangle forging a proud legacy of tenacity, grit and determination. Steel City. The City of Champions. Birthplace of Legends. Powered by heart and soul, Pittsburgh is a place where football is not just a sport, it's a way of life. It's the perfect place to host the NFL Draft.
While you can mark your calendars for Pittsburgh in 2026, specific event dates won’t be announced until 2025.
An exact footprint is yet to be determined, but we believe the NFL is largely interested in incorporating elements of Pittsburgh’s North Shore and Point State Park, while working to engage other key neighborhoods through supporting events. This will be an ongoing process over the next year to determine the best footprint for a seamless Pittsburgh Draft, and we will continue to share updates as details are finalized by the NFL.
The three-day event is expected to draw representatives from all 32 NFL teams, top player prospects from the most iconic football conferences in the nation and hundreds of thousands of attendees. The economic impact of previous Draft destinations has ranged between $120 million to upwards of $165 million.
Viewership of the NFL Draft has grown substantially to represent more than 50 million viewers worldwide, which provides an unmatched, near priceless global exposure opportunity for Pittsburgh.
