The Steelers will play in primetime on Sunday Night Football against the Dallas Cowboys, but on Friday night, they put on another primetime spectacular.
Fashion and football once again met head on at Steelers Style, the team's annual fashion show, which celebrated a milestone 50th Anniversary this year.
As a part of the celebration, players took the theme 'Suit Up' to heart, hitting the runway at Stage AE in their best looks, where all that glittered on this night was black and gold.
Guests were greeted with a football feel from the time they arrived, walking the green football carpet where they paused to have a moment to shine in front of the cameras.
As they awaited the main attraction, those in attendance enjoyed culinary delights while they were able to preview the latest fashions from the Steelers Pro Shop.
The show, which was co-chaired by Art and Greta Rooney and Mike and Kiya Tomlin, is the team's signature community event and loved by all who attend.
"This year we are celebrating the golden anniversary of our fashion show and its 50-year history," said Greta Rooney. "I am fortunate to be a part of this for 24 years and very proud to say we have raised millions of dollars for our local charities.
"You get to see our players off the field and on the stage. No helmet, with their families, personalities, and it makes for a fun night for everybody and for a good cause."
While fashion was the main attraction, as Greta Rooney said it was all for a good cause. All proceeds benefited the UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program, Cancer Bridges and the Chuck Noll Foundation.
"Doing it for the charities, that is the biggest thing," said defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi, one of the show's co-captains along with Pat Freiermuth. "It's important to give back. It's amazing what we do here, the tradition. It's an honor to be selected as one of the co-captains."
The players welcome the opportunity to combine fashion, team bonding and giving back to the community for a perfect evening filled with laughs, smiles and joy.
"It's awesome that it benefits such great causes," said Freiermuth. "I really appreciate Mr. Rooney and Greta thinking of me to be a co-captain with Larry. It's awesome I get to be a focal point of such an amazing event. I have been at it every year I have been here.
"It's an awesome event. Seeing all the Pittsburgh people out there supporting us not just on the field, but for this, is special."

This year's show was presented by Neighborhood Ford Store, PNC, UPMC, and UPMC Health Plan, who were all on board with supporting the causes.
"I am always really honored by their support," said Kiya Tomlin. "These are such big supporters of our Pittsburgh community, and for them to value the causes that we are supporting for this event and support so whole heartedly, I am honored."
When it comes to the fashion side of the show, Freiermuth and Ogunjobi are on the opposite spectrum, one happy to hang out in his sweats while the other has been tabbed as one of the best dressed on the squad by his teammates.
"My fashion is simple and comfy," said Freiermuth. "I have five pairs of sweatpants and sweatshirts that I just rotate through. My girlfriend gets pretty mad at me. I like what I like and that's what I wear.
"I do have a few suits, but I don't really wear them. If it's a primetime game I will, but I don't do anything crazy.
"It's good to do the show, get dressed up once in a while, see all of the guys on the team, be around their families and stuff. There are some fashionable guys on the team, Larry, Minkah (Fitzpatrick). A lot of guys. I wouldn't classify myself as one of them."
Ogunjobi, however, doesn't mind being classified as one of the best dressed.
"It's cool. I enjoy fashion," said Ogunjobi. "It's one of those things where it's look good, feel good, play good. I always try and look presentable, because that's how my parents raised me.
"When I first got in the league, I had guys like Christian Kirksey and Chris Smith take me under their wing when it comes to those kinds of things. I just thought it was cool.
"Wearing certain things, doing certain things, especially being a big man I think it just kind of opens a lot of doors and it's cool."
Ogunjobi is hands on with his fashion, picking out everything from the material to the design on custom suits. But he doesn't limit his style.
"It's a combination of urban street wear, but I have a lot of suits, so obviously, classic and sophisticated," said Ogunjobi. "It is a mix of that."
After an array of welcomes and sincere messages of thanks to all in attendance, it was time to get down to business.
As 'Suit Up' was introduced as the theme for the night, a video of players dressed in their best was shown, while players took the stage in their own styles, showing off what Steelers Style is all about.
But that was just a sneak peek. Before the players got going in their suits, they took the stage in their Sunday bestâ¦game jerseys.
It was all about showing off their unique personalities, as they chose their own walkout songs and brought a bit of swag with them as they walked the runway, tossing giveaways to the crowd along the way.
The game day vibe, with all of the latest fashions from the Steelers Pro Shop styled in fun and unique ways, brought energy with style and dancing taking center stage.
It was then time to throw things back to where the fashion show started, with a video montage of Steelers Style through the years, featuring images of players from every decade from the 1970s to the present, as well as fashions through the years.
It didn't stop there. The Steelers are also celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Super Bowl IX, the first Super Bowl the team won, and the night wouldn't have been complete without two stars from that team hitting the runway.
Hall of Fame cornerback Mel Blount and legendary running back Rocky Bleier hit the stage to the excitement of the packed house.
With the strongest female fan base in the NFL, it came as no surprise Women of Steel were highlighted in the show, with fashion and fun fully on display as Steelers wives took the stage.
Players have their own unique style, and Russell Wilson and some of his teammates stepped out in his Good Man Brand, which he launched in 2016 and is made for the man-on-the-move who seeks timeless, authentic, and sustainable style with a premium, modern edge.
Keeping it in the family, this year's 'halftime' musical performer was Mayce, the son of Mike and Kiya Tomlin. Mayce got into music at age 14 and has since embarked on a rap career, releasing the self-produced 'When Else But Now?' which features seven songs. Mayce recently opened for Poison frontman Bret Michaels on his Parti-Gras 2.0 tour at The Pavilion at Star Lake.
And for Mayce, it was quite the change for him, going from walking in the fashion show when he was a kid, to now performing in it.
"I walked a long time ago," said Mayce. "I was probably eight or so. It's been a while because it always was on a Friday night and I would be playing football. It's definitely a little weird. Just because I grew up around it to now being a legitimate part of it is kind of funny to me.
"I love performing. I knew what the energy was going to be. I've seen other people do the show that I know, and they said it was a great time.
"It was also a little bit special because I knew my entire family would be there, and there are multiple members of my family who had never seen me on stage including, but not limited to, my father."
Mike Tomlin has shied away from seeing him perform because he never wanted to take the spotlight off his son, but the fashion show was different.
"He's been such a big supporter of mine," said Mayce. "And for him to have the opportunity to see it, when I've been doing a lot of cool stuff lately and he's either at work or just doesn't want to be in the way. So, this is the one opportunity where he's like actually not in the way, he's going to be there anyway."
Mayce performed one of his newest releases, 'Rock Your Body,' energizing the crowd, including his famous dad.
"This is the song that I've been doing in all the Bret Michaels shows," said Mayce. "I make enough different kinds of music that I can kind of tailor it to the audience. I can switch it up and make something more fun, pop-like for the event."
Fashions by Kiya Tomlin are always a highlight of the show, and once again her designs didn't disappoint. Models dazzled in her unique designs that earned her the title of Best Fashion Designer in Pittsburgh in the Pittsburgh CityPaper's 2023 Reader's Poll.
"Our collection is for the fashion first fan," said Kiya Tomlin. "I am really excited, it's fashion forward, and stuff we are not used to seeing."
Up next was what everyone was waiting for as the 'Suit Up' theme took center stage.
Rookies first stepped out in custom suits designed by Surmesur, suits the players had a huge input in designing. From fittings to selecting everything from the pattern to the cut, it was a personalized experience, and it showed on the runway.
On tap next were veteran players, some with their wives and kids, stepping out in their own style and having fun the entire time.
"Honestly being able to hang out with the guys, get dressed up, sit around and eat together," said tight end Connor Heyward. "It's hanging out with each other. It's a good time for us to come together. It's guys, their wives and families. It's a cool thing.
"I think the Rooneys have been doing it for a lot of years. It's a tradition that will keep on going in Pittsburgh for however long they can, probably forever. It's a good time. A good way for us to connect with the people who support us as well."
While it was all in fun, don't think for a minute it wasn't competitive, as the annual swag awards are always heavily sought after. This year, though, it went a different direction, with two family swag awards presented. Russell Wilson and his wife Ciara and their kids as well as Donte Jackson and his daughters took the honors.
The celebration of 50 years of Steelers Style was one that won't soon be forgotten.

UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program: The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Sports Medicine Concussion Program, established in 2000, is the first of its kind and largest ongoing clinical service and research program that focuses on diagnosis, evaluation and management of sports-related concussion in athletes of all levels. Led by Michael Collins, PhD, the program's internationally known team of clinicians and researchers are world leaders in studying the neurocognitive effects of sports-related concussion and pioneering the development of better methods of post-concussion evaluation to determine when it is safe for an athlete to return to sports. The team provides oversight and consultation to assist sports teams' medical staff in making objective return-to-play decisions after the occurrence of sports-related concussion.
Cancer Bridges: Cancer Bridges supports those impacted by cancer through a variety of free programs and services and has been a proud beneficiary of Steelers Style since 1992. The organization provides a warm and welcoming environment for everyone impacted by cancer, including those with a diagnosis, survivors, and those who have a loved one with cancer or have experienced the loss of a loved one due to cancer. Cancer Bridges serves individuals of all ages and offers nearly 200 programs monthly, providing emotional, social, and informational tools for adults, youth, and families through counseling sessions, support groups, health and wellness programs, social activities, and more.
Chuck Noll Foundation: The Steelers launched the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in 2016 to support continued research and education regarding brain injuries and treatment of sports-related concussions. The Foundation funds research that it believes is the most promising in the area of sports-related concussions and related conditions. To help best evaluate which research programs to fund, some of the most renowned neurosurgeons in the country serve on a national medical advisory panel.
