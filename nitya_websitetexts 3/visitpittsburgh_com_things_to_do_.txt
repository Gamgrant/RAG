Pittsburgh is a modern, ever-evolving city where the must-sees vary week to week as Downtown-encompassing festivals, a vibrant Cultural District of world-class productions, fan-friendly sports events in iconic stadiums, and our distinct four seasons make each trip unique. Add in our award-winning culinary scene, craft beverage-packed neighborhoods and renowned museums you can enjoy throughout the year, and the only thing you won't have on your itinerary is free time. 
Need to extend your trip a day or two to get it all in? We figured.
Inclines and trolleys and riverboats (oh my)! There are so many ways to tour and sightsee around the city of Pittsburgh. 
You can take a tour by bike, trolley, boat, jet ski, kayak, funicular, bus or Segway, or go old fashioned and explore on your own two feet. Take a ride on the historic Duquesne Incline for panoramic views of the city's skyline and rivers. 
Outdoor enthusiasts can hike, bike and picnic at the numerous parks and green spaces, including Schenley Park and Point State Park. 
Our recommendation? Pick one of our 90 neighborhoods that make the city unique and explore.
