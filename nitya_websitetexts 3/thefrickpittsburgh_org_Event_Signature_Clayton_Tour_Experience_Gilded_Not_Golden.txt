Just announced! Gilded, Not Golden, the newly reinterpreted tour of Clayton, won a 2024 Leadership in History Award from the American Association for State and Local History.
"The tour guide did an excellent job of explaining the house details, decorative arts, family history & Gilded Age, in general. I particularly liked how history of the working class was woven in as a counterpoint to the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy."
