The Hall of Honor Museum takes fans on a trip through history that's minted in steel. If you weren't there for the iconic moments that shaped Steelers history, you should be HERE?
With six Super Bowl victories, the Pittsburgh Steelers are recognized as one of the storied franchises in the history of the National Football League.
To help honor the men who contributed to this success, the team announced it was creating a Hall of Honor in August 2017.
"The Hall of Honor will serve as a tribute to the many individuals who have contributed greatly throughout the history of our franchise," said Steelers President Art Rooney II. "This is probably long overdue, and we are excited to begin the process of recognizing these individuals and their accomplishments, both on and off the field, during an annual series of ceremonies."
Each year, the Steelers will induct former players, coaches, and contributors who were integral in sustaining the franchise's success. The standard by which the members of the Hall of Honor are selected are based on the following criteria:
The Hall of Honor's Inaugural Class was announced on Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017.
The formal induction ceremony took place during the team's annual Alumni Weekend celebration, which took place on Nov. 25-26, 2017
Each Hall of Honor inductee receives a solid steel football, which replicates the original given to Steelers' founder Art Rooney Sr. by the United States Steel Corporation and United Steel Workers in 1982 on the occasion of the team's 50th Season.
Each of the Hall of Honor members also are recognized with a plaque and a steel football in a special displayÂ located inside the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum located in Acrisure Stadium.
