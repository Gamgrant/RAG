​Along the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers, the North Shore boasts great views of Downtown.
Most famous for its iconic sports venues on the North Shore – Acrisure Stadium and PNC Park – it's also home to world-class museums and award-winning attractions. Take the T (the subway under the river…it's free) or walk to Rivers Casino, The Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory, Kayak Pittsburgh, National Aviary, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Science Center, to name a few! Make a note: It's one of the best places in the city to watch fireworks…and there are plenty of chances to do that!
The "North Shore" was once part of Allegheny City, a separate borough from Pittsburgh. It describes 18 smaller neighborhoods overlooking the city, including aptly named places like Fineview and Historic Deutchtown.
Don't miss the orange cart with the bright umbrella in West Park. Gus and Yia-Yia's serves old-fashioned, hand-scraped iceballs all summer long. Has been since 1934.
