The Steelers lost their second straight game of this 2024 regular season, this one by 20-17 to the Dallas Cowboys on a Dak Prescott touchdown pass with 15 seconds remaining. But despite an ending that spoiled the evening for most of the 67,380 at Acrisure Stadium, it was a historic night for T.J. Watt, who also was the team's best player.
Watt finished the game with 8 tackles, including 1 for loss, 1.5 sacks, and 1 forced fumble. The sacks gave Watt 101 for his career, and he became the second-fastest player since 1982 to reach 100 career sacks by doing it in 109 career games â behind Reggie White, who did it in 96 games. Watt also ranks third in NFL history with 101 sacks before his 30th birthday. The players ahead of him on that list are White with 108, and Jared Allen with 105. Watt will turn 30 on Oct. 11.
