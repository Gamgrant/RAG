Inspired by the power of the human voice to change lives, five visionary women founded Pittsburgh Opera, now the seventh oldest opera company in the United States. Today, Forever, our 80th Anniversary Campaign, honors their foresight and legacy as we prepare for our next 80 years.
Pittsburgh Opera has a significant record of excellence, authenticity, and passion. The superb quality of our on-stage productions, Resident Artists program, and community engagement initiatives is recognized internationally.
We are among the very few opera companies that owns our facilities for rehearsal, costumes, and administration. Our building was built in 1869 as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory, which perfectly illustrates Pittsburgh Opera’s deep and resonant connection to our region and our past.
