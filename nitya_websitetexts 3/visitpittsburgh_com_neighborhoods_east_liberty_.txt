The culturally diverse neighborhood of East Liberty today is undergoing a monumental redevelopment effort.
Google established offices here. Historic buildings are being rehabbed into boutique hotels. And, new restaurants are popping up all over. The neighborhood's greatest landmark, the East Liberty Presbyterian Church endures, but now embraces a diverse and socially active congregation, who call it the Cathedral of Hope.
Named for the common grazing lands - "liberties" - east of Pittsburgh's original settlement, East Liberty became a city neighborhood when the trolley lines arrived.
Two boutique hotels – The Maverick by Kasa and Indigo Hotel – are thriving.
