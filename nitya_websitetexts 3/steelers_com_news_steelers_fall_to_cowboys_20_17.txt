It might not have had the pageantry and glitz and glamor of some of their previous meetings, but Sunday night's Steelers game against the Cowboys at Acrisure Stadium didn't lack for drama.
T.J. Watt recorded the 100th sack of his career, becoming the first Steelers player to reach that number in his career.
It was all for naught, however, as Dallas, which had been turned away on three previous trips inside the Pittsburgh 20 earlier in the game, scored on a fourth down pass from the 4 with just 20 seconds remaining to lift the Cowboys to a 20-17 victory over the Steelers in a game delayed more than an hour by severe storms in the area.
On first-and-goal from the 4, Dak Prescott ran inside the 1. On second down, linebacker Elandon Roberts hit running back Rico Dowdle at the 1, forcing a fumble back to the 4 where Prescott fell on it, just beating several Steelers to the loose ball.
"There's a fine line between drinking wine and squashing grapes in our business, and that's an example of it," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "That ball was on the ground right there in the red area, and that's the difference."

Prescott threw incomplete on third down, before completing a 4-yard touchdown to Jalen Tolbert in the left flat with just 20 seconds remaining.
"That's on me," said safety DeShon Elliott, who was in coverage on the play. "I thought we had it. It's on me, man. It's on me. I gave up the touchdown."
Justin Fields threw two touchdown passes, the second of which came with just under five minutes remaining in the game, helping offset a night when the offense was just 3 of 12 on third downs as the Steelers lost their second game in a row after a 3-0 start to fall to 3-2.
Prescott completed 29 of 42 passes for 352 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions as Dallas improved to 3-2. Dallas was 9 of 15 on third down conversions and held the ball for 32:29.
The Steelers struggled to keep their offense on the field in the first half, going just 1 of 7 on third downs. But the defense held up, keeping the game at 6-3 by forcing a pair of turnovers by the Cowboys in the red zone.
Both teams kicked field goals on their opening possessions, the Cowboys getting a 55-yarder from Brandon Aubrey, while the Steelers got a 41-yarder from Chris Boswell.
On its third possession, Dallas drove to the Pittsburgh 11. But Prescott was sacked by Watt and Nick Herbig, with Watt forcing the ball loose. Herbig gathered the ball in to turn Dallas away without points.
The Cowboys did add a second Aubrey field goal in the second quarter, this one from 35 yards, to take a 6-3 lead.
Just before the two-minute warning, Prescott connected with Jalen Tolbert for a 48-yard catch down the sideline on third-and-4, and the Cowboys drove to the Pittsburgh 15. But Donte Jackson picked Prescott off in the end zone to end the threat.
The Steelers got the ball to open the second half and quickly marched 72 yards for the game's first touchdown.
Fields had to briefly leave the field to go to the medical tent after Tyrus Wheat was penalized for roughing the passer. Fields seemed OK following the hit, but the independent spotter had him checked for a concussion.
Seeing his first action with the Steelers, backup Kyle Allen completed a 19-yard pass to Pat Freiermuth and Fields was back in the game after two plays. He finished off the drive with a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Connor Heyward that gave the Steelers a 10-6 lead with 11:50 remaining in the third quarter.
Dallas tried to answer and Prescott connected with Turpin down the seam on a 32-yard pass to the Pittsburgh 21. But Watt recorded a sack on second down and after a short completion, Aubrey attempted a 38-yard field goal that was blocked by defensive tackle Isaiahh Loudermilk, Dallas' third trip inside the Pittsburgh 20 that ended without points.
Having been thwarted three times inside the Pittsburgh 20, the Cowboys skipped over the red zone on their next possession, with Prescott throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Dowdle as Dallas regained the lead, 13-10, with 13:51 remaining in the fourth quarter.
The Steelers were forced into another three-and-out, giving Dallas the ball back. But with 10:28 remaining, Joey Porter Jr. picked off a deep pass attempt by Prescott, returning it out to the Dallas 37.
The Steelers finally converted a third down, their first since the opening drive, on a run by Fields, then converted a fourth-and-1 play as they drove to the Dallas 6. On second down, Fields flipped a shovel pass to Freiermuth for a 6-yard touchdown pass that gave the Steelers a 17-13 lead with 4:56 remaining.
The Cowboys outgained the Steelers 445 to 222 in total yards and had 25 first downs compared to 17 for Pittsburgh.
"I'm going to compliment our guys on their efforts. It was a hard-fought game tonight, but it's nothing mystical about the outcome," said Tomlin. "I just thought we didn't do enough over 60 minutes to position ourselves specifically. I thought we started slow offensively, and I thought it was self-inflicted wounds, penalties and things of that nature to get us off schedule.
"I didn't think we were as connected as we should have been defensively and some moments in the first half didn't necessarily manifest itself in terms of points, but it was some field positional, flipping like chunks and things of that nature. I thought we settled down and cleaned some of that up over the second half, but obviously when you are playing a good team, and particularly a guy like Dak Prescott, you are in tight ball games, he ends up with the ball last, you got a chance to lose. That's really just a synopsis of what transpired."
