Home to prestigious museums, world-class hospitals and universities and international cuisine, Oakland is considered the cultural, academic and medical center of Pittsburgh.
As one of Pittsburgh's liveliest neighborhoods, you'll find cool coffee shops, multi-cultural eateries and interesting specialty shops alongside grand architecture. Oakland is the place to be whether you're planning a picnic in the park, enjoying an evening of drama or seeking an art or history fix.
Intellectual, international and cultural. Where "eds and meds" intersect with culture and heritage.
Oakland got its name from the abundance of oak trees found on the farm of William Eichbaum, who settled there in 1840. The name Eichbaum translates to "oak tree" in German.
The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall & Museum honors the various wars in which local soldiers participated and is home to a face casting taken directly from Abraham Lincoln the month he died.
