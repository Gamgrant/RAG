QuÃ© rÃ¡pido se estÃ¡ pasando la temporada regular de la NFL, ya vamos a cumplir el mes de actividad y los Steelers mantienen marca invicta de 3 partidos ganados y cero perdidos en este muy buen arranque de la campaÃ±a 2024. En esta ocasiÃ³n toca ir de visita a IndianÃ¡polis donde los Pittsburgh Steelers buscarÃ¡n su cuarta victoria consecutiva el prÃ³ximo domingo 29 de septiembre.
Mike Tomlin hablÃ³ sobre la situaciÃ³n del quarterback y apuntÃ³ que es muy parecido a lo que sucediÃ³ la semana pasada. "Me reunÃ­ con Ã©l y con nuestro preparador fÃ­sico y me comentaron que sigue siendo un escenario de participaciÃ³n limitada, asÃ­ que estamos en el entendido de que Justin (Fields) se preparÃ¡ en la semana para iniciar el partido y estar listo para el domingo".
Fields viene de un muy buen juego por aire en contra de los Chargers con 245 yardas y aunque sabemos de sus recursos por tierra, tambiÃ©n habrÃ¡ que tener mucho cuidado con el pass rush de los Colts, quienes solamente en la semana 3 contra los Bears hicieron 4 capturas sobre Caleb Williams.
La defensiva de IndianÃ¡polis luce bastante sÃ³lida, especialmente el juego terrestre, en el partido pasado permitieron Ãºnicamente 2.3 yardas por acarreo para 63 yardas totales. Un matchup favorecedor y que puede ayudar a nuestra ofensiva es Pat Freiermuth, los Colts han sido de las peores defensivas contra alas cerradas en este primer mes de actividad.
Sobre la ofensiva de nuestro rival podemos destacar a Anthony Richardson, una amenaza dual por aire y tierra pero que no ha sido el mejor protector del balÃ³n en este inicio de temporada, cometiendo muchos errores no forzados al momento de lanzar el balÃ³n. De quiÃ©n habrÃ¡ que tener cuidado es de Jonathan Taylor y ese serÃ¡ un matchup vital para poder salir con la victoria el domingo. Taylor corriÃ³ 110 yardas y 2 touchdowns la semana pasada pero ahora tendrÃ¡ frente a Ã©l a la defensiva de acero que solamente permitiÃ³ 2.9 yardas por acarreo a J.K Dobbins el domingo pasado.
No es noticia para nadie que la defensiva de los Steelers ha sido clave no solamente en 2024, sino a lo largo de los aÃ±os para mantener el equipo en un nivel competitivo alto, de hecho en estos tres primeros partidos los Steelers son lÃ­deres defensivos en puntos permitidos en promedio por partido con 8.7 y en yardas permitidas en promedio por partido con 229.7.
Este partido lo pueden disfrutar por la seÃ±al de Fox Sports en MÃ©xico a las 11 de la maÃ±ana tiempo del centro de MÃ©xico y pueden seguir la transmisiÃ³n por steelers.com con Ãlvaro MartÃ­n y Arturo Carlos o por la seÃ±al de NFL Game Pass.
