The Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix (PVGP), celebrating its 42nd anniversary in 2024, is the nation's largest vintage street race and the only one staged on public roads.
It’s considered by drivers to be the most challenging racecourse worldwide with its tight turns, elevation changes and natural obstacles like stone walls, curbs, manhole covers and telephone poles.
