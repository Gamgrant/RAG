In 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion was in full force because of farmers rebelling against the whisky task which in return made western Pennsylvania a hub for a lot of distilleries during that time. This changed when prohibition came into effect where it made it illegal to produce and sell alcohol.Fast forward to the year 2000, when the whole state of Pennsylvania had only one distillery. Today, there are around 70 in the state with more than a dozen of those located in Allegheny County.
