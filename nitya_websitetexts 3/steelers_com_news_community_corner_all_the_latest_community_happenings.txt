Reaching out to area youth: Steelers players were out and about in the community today, using their off day to give back in numerous manners.
Calvin Austin III and Thomas Graham Jr. spent time at CafÃ© Momentum, where they met with Liz Ryan, the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention for the United States.
CafÃ© Momentum Pittsburgh is a place where Pittsburghers can go and enjoy fine dining. It also offers a culinary internship to teens 15 to 19 who are justice-involved. CafÃ© Momentum, which originated in Dallas, provides a transformative experience through a 12-month paid post-release internship program. Participants rotate through the restaurant, focusing on life and social skills, coaching and development.
Throughout the month of October, the Steelers will be working with organizations around the city as a part of Youth Justice Action Month (YJAM) to raise awareness about the impact of the justice system on children and the organizations that are working to make a positive impact in the community.
Youth Justice Action Month (YJAM) is an annual campaign where advocates come together to organize digital and in-person events and activities to raise awareness and inspire action on behalf of young people impacted by the justice system.
This year is also the 50th Anniversary of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Action, which is a United States federal law providing formula grants to states that follow a series of federal protections on the care and treatment of youth in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems.
Cooking for a cause: As a part of breast cancer awareness month, and in conjunction with the NFL's Crucial Catch initiative, Steelers players took part in the annual Healthy Cooking Demo with UPMC.  
Isaiahh Loudermilk and DeShon Elliott led the cooking demo at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital, making it a fun and meaningful afternoon for breast cancer patients and survivors.
The players prepared healthy food options, giving a variety of tasty, yet healthy treats.
"Nutrition to me is important," said Elliott. "It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle. I prefer to eat healthy."
For Loudermilk, being part of the cooking class is personal as his mother, Stacy Howell, is a breast cancer survivor.
"It means a lot to me," said Loudermilk of taking part in the cooking class. "I'm personally affected by it, growing up with my mom having breast cancer. Being able to come out here now and educate myself on making these healthy meals, and putting smiles on faces is always a great time. It means a lot to me to be here."
Loudermilk said he is simple when it comes to his cooking style, while Elliott has worked on perfecting his cooking skills.
What they both have perfected, though, is giving back to the community.
"As much as God has blessed me, I do my due diligence to give back to the community," said Elliott. "Why not bring happiness and joy to them."
School days: Linebacker T.J. Watt and his wife Dani were busy on Tuesday, visiting multiple schools in the Pittsburgh area as part of the Steelers back to school blitz.
Watt began his day at Pittsburgh King, where he read to the students and then handed out supply bags to help the kids in the school year.
"It's fun. It really is," said Watt. "To see the excitement, to feel the excitement, I haven't been around a bunch of screaming kids at 9:30 in the morning ever.
"It's fun to be able to do it with Dani. Having a little one on the way, it puts things more into perspective about people who are less fortunate and don't have the school supplies or the toiletries to be able to go to school and not have to worry about those things, and that's what we're trying to provide.
"It's such a busy time of year, but it's so important on these Tuesdays, our off days, that we take the time to get out in the community and show people that we're not just on television and we are separated. I want to bridge that gap and show people that we care, and we want to help them as much as possible."
It was then off to Pittsburgh Milliones where he took questions from the kids and again handed out supply bags.
"That was funny. They asked my favorite class, and I don't have a favorite class if I am being honest with anyone," said Watt. "The questions, it's always surreal when kids are nervous to ask questions. I have to remember, to them I am some big guy. But I am such a normal goofball that I forget that sometimes. The kids had great questions, and it was fun to be able to answer some of them."
Watt did the event in conjunction with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources.
Golf for a cause: Pat Freiermuth, Jalen Elliott and Rodney Williams took part in the annual Tee Up Fore Bundle-Up Mini Golf Classic at Puttshack Pittsburgh.
The fun event included a competitive nine-hold round of miniature golf, dinner and prizes all benefitting Project Bundle-Up.
The Salvation Army's Project Bundle-Up is a program started by two late Pittsburgh staples, Patricia Rooney, the wife of late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, and Joe DeNardo, the former WTAE-TV weatherman. The program is focused on providing winter outwear for kids and others in need in the Pittsburgh area and focusing on taking them shopping to pick out their own items.
We had a great time at Langley K-8 at our Steelers Phys Ed Class!Special thanks to Rodney Williams, for joining us today ð@GiantEagle pic.twitter.com/GzGltlzGI2
A wish comes true: Friday was a special day for Bryant Sanchez, a 19-year-old from Orange County, Ca., who was the guest of the Steelers and the Make-A-Wish Foundation at the team's practice at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.
Sanchez, who has leukemia, got to enjoy watching practice up close and personal, as well as meet some of his favorite players following practice, which included getting plenty of pictures and autographs.
"This is really exciting," said Sanchez. "Just because I am here with my family, this is my first time seeing the Steelers here at a home game. I have never been to a game before. This is exciting."
Sanchez will also attend the Steelers game this week against the Chargers at Acrisure Stadium as a guest of the team.
"At first I wanted my wish to just be a jersey," said Sanchez. "I felt like I would end up getting too sick coming here. But being here is just different.
"I never really knew about football until a friend of mine told me to join football with him. My cousin was a Steelers fan, so I went with them.
"I am pretty stoked to go to the game. My family and I, we never really do anything like this so it's awesome."

Fighting hunger: Steelers rookies spent Tuesday morning visiting the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, an organization that is making a massive difference in the region.
The rookies toured the facility, which now includes The Market, an onsite pantry where recipients can select their own items and there is no judgement, and all are treated with dignity and respect. The items are all available at no cost and include fresh produce, meats, shelf-stable foods and more.
The players also took part in packing produce for distribution, giving them a unique understanding of what is needed to help those who are struggling with food insecurity.
Taking care of kids: Tight end Pat Freiermuth has always been passionate about giving back to the Pittsburgh community, loving the ability to interact with others, especially with kids while bringing them joy.
That is why he was out and about on his off day, providing school supplies to students at Pittsburgh Mifflin to aid them in the school year.
Freiermuth worked hand-in-hand with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources.

Heroes night out: The Steelers hosted the annual Heroes Night Out at Acrisure Stadium, honoring the men and women of the military by providing a fun night of football drills with some of their favorite players, as well as camaraderie with others who have or are currently serving our country.
The team worked with local branches of the military, including the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard.
"We're really excited to take part in events like this in the community and also bring the different branches together," said Master Sgt. Starsha Jyachosky of the U.S. Army. "It's nice to be thought of like this. It makes us feel like we are part of the community to be asked to come out to an event like this. We are having some fun banter back and forth and it's awesome.
"There is a smile on everybody's face. It's so much fun to take part in this.
"It means the world to service members to do this. It's something a lot of them don't get to do. To be invited down here and interact with the players is a once in a lifetime opportunity for a lot of them."
The event traditionally has been held in the days leading up to or after the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and as part of that there was a somber moment of silence to honor all of the lives that were lost on the horrific day.
While those who were lost were still on their minds, the members of the military were able to relax as well and enjoy a night that was focused solely on them.
Three football stations, including passing, receiving and field goal kicking, were set up around the field, a perfect opportunity for the military members to test their skill level with those who do it for a living.
Among the players taking part were Keeanu Benton, Jalen Elliott, Thomas Graham Jr., Christian Kuntz and Isaiahh Loudermilk.
In addition to the drills, the players posted for pictures with the military members as they shared stories of watching football while on deployment.
"It's important because they give of their time to do well by us," said Benton. "I feel like by any means, if I can do the same, I will do it. being out here giving back.
"It's about the interaction for me. Not that I can't teach them skills, but the interaction part is something they don't get to do every day with NFL players.
"This just goes to show the culture we have here with the Steelers, making ourselves available to do things like this."

Back to school blitz continues: Defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi continued the spirit of helping kids heading back to the classroom when he hosted his third annual Back To School event. Ogunjobi provided backpacks and school supplies to 300 kids at Urban Academy in Pittsburgh.
"I love having the opportunity to give every single year and to be an integral part of the start of the school year," said Ogunjobi. "Great school supplies are the foundation of a successful school year, it's always good to come back and see familiar faces, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group of bright students."
Ogunjobi has worked with Urban Academy the past three years, a school known for their S.T.E.M. program, something that hits home for him as he earned his degree in computer science and biology from North Carolina Charlotte.
"The Urban Academy community thanks Larry and the Pittsburgh Steelers for their ongoing commitment to our students and community," said Chase Patterson, CEO of Urban Academy. "For the third consecutive year, Larry's generosity is making a difference in supporting our student's success. Larry and the Steelers organization continue to demonstrate their overarching dedication to uplifting and investing in young people's futures. On behalf of the entire Urban Academy family, thank you for your unwavering support and partnership."
Back to school ready: Safety DeShon Elliott has already immersed himself in the Pittsburgh community, hosting a back-to-school event for area students on Thursday evening.
"The kids are our pillars. Growing up, football was important to me, but my parents also preached education," said Elliott. "I am not just doing back to school supplies, but clothes and shoes too. It's hard for parents, especially single parent homes, and I have two sisters who are single mothers, and it can be hard to try and provide everything you need for school. That takes a burden off the kids and the moms. The kids can then just focus on their education.
"And this is an opportunity for me to give back to my hometown, which is now here."
Elliott took a group of kids shopping for their back-to-school needs as well as shoes and clothes, making sure they are set for the new school year. He also spent time interacting with the kids, being present, which is sometimes one of the most important aspects.
"It means a lot," said Elliott. "I am giving back, but being there, showing up, that means a lot to kids. Being able to talk to them, and them learning from me, who I am, answering questions. Talking to kids about football, other things. I just want to be hands on and really get to know them."
Making back to school cool: Linebacker Alex Highsmith hosted his 3rd Annual Back to School Bash for 300 area students at the LaRosa Youth Club in McKeesport.
Highsmith handed out backpacks, books and school supplies to the students through the Alex Highsmith Family Foundation. In addition, the foundation provided free haircuts, water bottles, and to-go meals to provide the kids a nutritious option as the school year is set to begin.
"We are incredibly excited to host this event once again and to continue our mission of giving back to the community," said Highsmith. "Providing these resources helps ensure that every child has the tools they need to succeed academically and start the school year with confidence."
Back to school in style: The new school year is about to get underway for many kids in the area, and the importance of sending kids back to the classroom with all the necessities is definitely a priority.
That is why the Steelers joined forces with others to be a part of the 12th Annual Pittsburgh Public Schools Back to School Event at Acrisure Stadium.
This year, Cameron Heyward's foundation, The Heyward House, and Russell Wilson's Why Not You Foundation, are working hand-in-hand with the team and the Mentoring Partnership to provide support for kids and families, with the theme, 'Students firstâ¦Always, in all ways.'
To give the kids a fresh start for school, the Steelers provided haircuts, hairstyles and manicures, giving everyone a self-esteem boost. Working with The Heyward House and Why Not You Foundation, they also provided hygiene kits and books. In addition, they connected the students with much needed resources that will benefit them throughout their educational endeavors.
Students were able to attend the event in person and take advantage of all of the activities, or participate in the drive-thru version where they were able to still get free school supplies and other essentials without having to leave their car.
The event was also something the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation were a part of.

Young Black Motivated Kings & Queens (YBMKQ) is a community-based organization in Pittsburgh made up of some of the most dedicated young men and women in the city who have chosen to stand apart and show the community that young black kings and queens are active, motivated, and empowered to be the change.
The mission is to counteract this narrative by embracing the agency and inviting others to do the same, no matter their circumstance or background.
The organization engages elementary, middle and high-school-aged youth in becoming the leaders of tomorrow while serving the community.

"With the Youth Leadership Initiative, we're able to work with more kids and have a broader reach," said Blount. "One of the things that we've done is connected with other youth organizations around Western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Washington County, Greene County, Westmoreland County. So, we have a broader reach now. We're able to work and be more effective, reaching more kids. It gives kids, even kids who are not in the system, an opportunity to experience what our program has to offer and help them grow and develop."
The idea behind the visit is to help inspire the kids who are taking part and teach the importance of teamwork as the kids go through a series of physical challenges designed for them to work together in teams.

Flag football fun: Steelers Hall of Fame safety Troy Polamalu and his wife, Theodora, hosted the inaugural Resilience Bowl at Acrisure Stadium on Tuesday.
The evening was highlighted by a seven-on-seven flag football game, featuring an array of former Steelers players like Jerome Bettis, Ben Roethlisberger and Hines Ward, as well as celebrities such as rapper Fedd the God, actor and comedian Billy Gardell, and actor/musician Chip Esten.
Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and Hall of Famer and former Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau served as the coaches for the game.
The competition was intense, with Polamalu's team coming out on top.
"It's the city that is hosting us tonight in a lot of ways. In that mindset, I am very grateful to be back, to see all of the faces here, to see the team," said Polamalu. "It's nice to be back in the fold in a very meaningful way. We do a lot of charitable work for the community, but to come back here, bring back the alumni, give back to the team."
The event benefits the Neighborhood Resilience Project, an organization the Steelers have a strong bond with.
"Considering the Neighborhood Resilience Project, and the Neighborhood Resilience Institute, and the amazing things they have done, this is great to be a part of," said Polamalu. "The Resilience Project, first and foremost it's a framework that allows the community to heal within. Oftentimes, when people look at trauma, especially the case of trauma in communities, you have a separate figure that is trying to impose certain programs on a community. Some of them are helpful, some not so helpful. The beautiful thing about the Neighborhood Resilience Project is that it's healing from within. It's a framework that allows people that live in the community to talk to people in positions of power, and then they become people of power, and enlighten us to bring healing to the community."
The organization brought hundreds of kids from the Greater Pittsburgh region to enjoy a night where they can see Steelers legends up close.
"This night means so much to them," said Rev. Paul T. Abernathy, CEO of Neighborhood Resilience Project. "For them to have a chance to see some of the Steelers legends, Super Bowl champions, Hall of Famers. It's bringing so much excitement to our youth.
"This event is so fun. Just to have an event this fun and offer it as a night of enjoyment for our region to come together and celebrate all that people in our community have accomplished establishing resiliency, it's just incredible."
The vision of the Neighborhood Resilience Project is to inspire a movement in which suffering people are raised up from the ashes of trauma in unconditional love to become empowered healers, community builders, and positive change makers. The project is rooted in the Gospel and teachings of the Orthodox Church, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s.
"This has been a tremendous blessing to us," said Rev. Abernathy. "Troy and Theodora Polamalu are truly gems, not only for our organization, but the entire community. The Steelers organization is showing us tonight that as a region we can come together, we can remember those who are suffering the most among us. We can as a region, with this kind of leadership from the Steelers and the Polamalus heal the pain in our communities. This is inspiring so many people in our community. The excitement in our underserved community is beyond words, it's bringing new life to us all."
Pizza, pizza: Cameron Heyward won the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year, and so far in 2024 he has shown he has no plans of slowing down.

Celebrating a special day: Last year, Miles Killebrew wanted to do something special for his 30th birthday, and for someone who isn't a fan of big parties and a lot of attention, he found the perfect way to celebrate.
He enjoyed it so much, he opted for the same celebration this year.
Instead of making his birthday celebration all about himself, he celebrated his birthday, which is May by hanging out with patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, hanging out and delivering gifts to unsuspecting kids.
It was a great day for the kids, who were smiling from ear to ear as their spirits picked up with the fun surprise, which included Killebrew dressing up as Batman.
Birthday time: Defensive tackle Cameron Heyward celebrated his birthday on Monday, but on Wednesday, he threw a party for others.
Heyward hosted his annual birthday bash at Dave & Busters for a group of local kids, including many who are served through The Caring Place.
The kids were able to play video games with Heyward and some of his teammates, as well as enjoy dinner and just have fun interacting with each other.
The Caring Place an organization he has been involved with, including as part of Cam's Kindness Week last year.
The Caring Place offers programs to support children and families who are grieving after a devastating loss. And the statistics are sad, as one in 20 kids will have a parent die before they graduate from high school. Heyward is one of those statistics and that is why he wanted to give back. His father, Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward died when he was just 16-years old, the summer before his senior year of high school.
Very thankful to have @steelers teammates, @97HeywardHouse @CaringPlacePa all partner up to spend some time @ Dave & Busters for some pretty great kids!!!
Smiles all around: Quarterback Russell Wilson brought smiles, and Terrible Towels, to patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh on Tuesday.
Wilson stopped by the hospital to visit with the kids, something that lifted the spirits of everyone he spent time with. And Wilson himself had a fantastic time.
"What I have learned is that much is given, much is required," said Wilson. "I believe that."
During the visit, Wilson took time to learn more about each one of the kids, learn about their ability to fight through adversity as some have gone beyond what doctors could have ever expected in their health battles.
"It's about their fight," said Wilson. "It's inspiring to see that. To see the mentality. It's important not only for me, but so many of us other athletes to be able express how much these young kids mean to us.
"The thing I always realized, doing a lot of things with cancer, and things like that for kids, you realize that number one you never know if it's somebody you know, number two you never know if it's somebody that could be yours one day. To be able to give back and be able to impact is important."
Wilson is no stranger to giving back in this manner, something he did previously in other cities where he has played and something he truly does from the heart.
"My dad was always in hospitals, my mom was an ER nurse," said Wilson. "I've seen a lot. I've seen a lot of miracles happen too. I've seen a lot of good things happen.
"When you go into a room with a lot of love, a lot of hope, anything is possible. When you have great doctors and nurses and people that are spending so much time for these young, amazing kids, you want to cherish those moments."
Amazing visit today @ChildrensPGH!!! The sweetest kids! Keep fighting! Keep overcoming! ð¤ð pic.twitter.com/4aGtY2ht4s
Set for success: Cameron Heyward and The Heyward House hosted the annual Suiting Up for Success Soiree at the Grand Concourse, celebrating the accomplishments of local high school seniors.
Heyward celebrated male high school seniors in the Pittsburgh area, all chosen by their schools for their leadership, character and ability to overcome challenges faced by today's youth. The Heyward House provided each of them with a custom suit and all the accessories through his 'Craig's Closet' program, as well as a photo shoot and a private dinner with Heyward.
The program is one of the many that earned Heyward the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award.
Craig's Closet has been a staple for The Heyward House since 2018, launched in honor of his late father, Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward, who died from a brain tumor in 2006, at just 39 years old.
His father played football at the University of Pittsburgh, and when he arrived as a freshman running back, he had only one suit, something he was grateful to have since he came from a single-parent home with six siblings.
With so many young men in Pittsburgh facing the same challenge of not having a suit that they could wear to a job interview, internship, events and more, Heyward produced a plan. Craig's Closet provides free dress clothes to help young men as they move forward in life, and the Suiting Up for Success program is an extension of that.
"The idea came from my dad," said Heyward. "When he grew up, he only had one suit. A lot of his friends didn't have suits at all. This is a creative way we thought of to give back to the community and help prepare young men for jobs, or homecoming, moving forward in life. You never know how much a suit can help you present yourself."
Cam Heyward Day: Wednesday was declared 'Cam Heyward Day' in the City of Pittsburgh, honoring the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year.
Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Pittsburgh City Council presented him with a proclamation for his work that has benefited so many in the city.
"I just want to thank you for all of the work that you have done," said Gainey. "You have done a lot of work in the city. I am appreciative, because it speaks volumes of how you use your platform. I always think you should use your platform to uplift other people, and you have done that. I just want to personally say thank you.
"And I like the way you tackle quarterbacks. I appreciate that."
Gainey went on to read the proclamation honoring Heyward for winning the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award, recognizing him for his on and off the field efforts.
"He is among the most respected names in the National Football League," the proclamation read. "Throughout his 13-year career he has been deeply involved in helping the community and always using his platform for good. Throughout his distinguished career, Cam has exemplified the highest standards of professionalism, compassion and consistency, going above and beyond the call of duty, and providing life-changing care for support of youth throughout the region.
"Today is your day. We appreciate you. Today is Cam Heyward Day."
Heyward, who has been a staple in the community since he was drafted by the Steelers in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft, was humbled to be honored by the city when he was born and played his entire career.
"Thank you to Mayor Gainey, (City) Council, and everybody out here today," said Heyward. "When I talk about using my platform to draw awareness or help others out, that's not accomplished without a village behind me. It's not done without people taking an effort to give back. I would like to think I am a representative of that.
"I am very appreciative of this proclamation. When I tell my kids today is Cam Heyward Day, they might freak out a little bit and hopefully I can get a cupcake on top of that. My kids, I am just trying to show them the way and I am trying to lead my family and provide for them a model of how to represent your city. Not everybody gets to be a Pittsburgh Steeler, but when you are a Pittsburgh Steeler, there is a level of consistency, a standard to be held and a responsibility to the city. That is something I will always do. We've got a lot more work to do, and I am looking forward to doing it."
Alex Highsmith Day: Steelers linebacker Alex Highsmith had his day in the sun when Wilmington, North Carolina celebrated 'Alex Highsmith Day' on April 6.
Highsmith, who grew up in Wilmington, was recognized by Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo for his work on and off the field.
Highsmith was honored in particular for his work with the Highsmith Family Foundation, which is dedicated to the advancement and enrichment of underserved youth, professional development of our nation's educators, and providing opportunities for growth and connection to flourish. The foundation does work in Wilmington, Pittsburgh, and Charlotte, where he attended college. He also works closely with the Barbara Highsmith Reading Academy.
"God has blessed me with this platform, to just be a light for him and do it all for his glory," said Highsmith. "So, knowing that the main reason I have this platform is not just to play football but to make a difference and be a blessing to others. Knowing that I have this platform, I know it comes with great responsibility and that is to give back to others and make a difference."
Highsmith is committed to the Pittsburgh community as well, hosting events for various organizations, while attending team and community events in an effort to give back and make a difference.
"Ultimately, I know that I can make a lasting difference in the community," said Highsmith. "Just by going out and doing different things with the kids and being a role model for them, that's what matters to me most."
