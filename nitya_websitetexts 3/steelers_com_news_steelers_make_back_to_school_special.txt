Students in the Pittsburgh area have returned to the classroom this fall, many of them with stylish new backpacks and necessary supplies thanks to the efforts of Steelers players the last few weeks.
The Steelers had a back-to-school blitz, with multiple players stepping up to provide the essentials for the kids, something that is a priority for many in the organization.
In all, the Steelers supported more than 4,500 kids with school supplies, some of them also receiving things like hair care, hygiene kits and more.
"Back to school is the beginning of the season and really it's an opportunity for our guys to start the season strong," said Blayre Holmes-Davis, the Steelers senior director of community relations. "This year we have had more back-to-school events than we've had previously, including new guys stepping up. We know there's a lot of communities that talk about back-to-school time, they talk about school supplies and everything. But not every school district and not every student has the necessities to start the school year strong. That can be from having a haircut to just having a highlighter and a notebook and everything that they need.
"I think it's great for our guys to want to pour back into the community. Also, being there to want to give things out in person and make sure that they see them face to face to say we're here to support you. While they play on Sunday, they make time during the week to make sure they're in the community as well.
"It's really meaningful to see the guys go into those schools and provide them with those supplies. But also let them know that they're there to support them. They're there to make sure that not only the beginning of the school year, but throughout the entire school year. They want them to know that they're there to support them and cheer them on as much as our community does on Sunday."
The team kicked it off when they joined forces with the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Penguins Foundation for the 12th Annual Pittsburgh Public Schools Back to School Event at Acrisure Stadium.
This year, Cameron Heyward's foundation, The Heyward House, and Russell Wilson's Why Not You Foundation, worked hand-in-hand with the team and the Mentoring Partnership to provide support for kids and families, with the theme, 'Students firstâ¦Always, in all ways.'
"Much is given, much is required," said Wilson. "I think the ability to give back and care about our youth is key. We were once kids who were trying to make it and trying to be inspired and trying to dream big. For us, for me and Ciara in particular, we have our own kids, and we always try and inspire others.
"But the most important thing is encouraging kids, why not you. If we can do it, you can do it."
To give the kids a fresh start for school, the Steelers provided haircuts, hairstyles and manicures, giving everyone a self-esteem boost. Working with The Heyward House and Why Not You Foundation, they also provided hygiene kits and books. In addition, they connected the students with much needed resources that will benefit them throughout their educational endeavors.
"For some parents there can be a lot of anxiety where they are thinking about do our kids have a backpack, all the right amenities to go to school," said Heyward. "It was about giving the kids a jumpstart on the school year by providing stuff and sending them on their merry way for a good school year."
Students were able to attend the event in person and take advantage of all of the activities or participate in the drive-thru version where they were able to still get free school supplies and other essentials without having to leave their car.

Linebacker T.J. Watt and his wife Dani spent one of their off days visiting multiple schools in the Pittsburgh area to give back.
Watt made a stop at Pittsburgh King, where he read to the students and then handed out supply bags to help the kids in the school year.
"It's fun. It really is," said Watt. "To see the excitement, to feel the excitement, I haven't been around a bunch of screaming kids at 9:30 in the morning ever.
"It's fun to be able to do it with Dani. Having a little one on the way, it puts things more into perspective about people who are less fortunate and don't have the school supplies or the toiletries to be able to go to school and not have to worry about those things, and that's what we're trying to provide.
"It's such a busy time of year, but it's so important on these Tuesdays, our off days, that we take the time to get out in the community and show people that we're not just on television and we are separated. I want to bridge that gap and show people that we care, and we want to help them as much as possible."
He also visited Pittsburgh Milliones, where he took questions from the kids and again handed out supply bags.
"That was funny. They asked my favorite class, and I don't have a favorite class if I am being honest with anyone," said Watt. "The questions, it's always surreal when kids are nervous to ask questions. I have to remember, to them I am some big guy. But I am such a normal goofball that I forget that sometimes. The kids had great questions, and it was fun to be able to answer some of them."
Watt did the event in conjunction with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources.
Tight end Pat Freiermuth also worked with The Education Partnership for a school distribution.
Freiermuth has always been passionate about giving back to the Pittsburgh community, loving the ability to interact with others, especially with kids while bringing them joy.
"I want to be involved in the community more," said Freiermuth. "My parents, really my whole family are teachers, so just being able to give back to the public school system is something I take pride in.
"It's personal for me. My family is involved in the public school system and just seeing what they go through with funding and so forth, what kids experience, I just want to help."
Freiermuth worked with Pittsburgh Mifflin to provide supplies to the students there to aid them in the school year.
He also provided plenty of smiles as he spent time with the kids.
"Nothing beats it," said Freiermuth. "It puts a smile on their face, it puts a smile on my face. It's good to be in a position where I can give back."
Linebacker Alex Highsmith hosted his 3rd Annual Back to School Bash for 300 area students at the LaRosa Youth Club in McKeesport.
Highsmith handed out backpacks, books and school supplies to the students through the Alex Highsmith Family Foundation. In addition, the foundation provided free haircuts, water bottles, and to-go meals to ensure a nutritious option at the start of the school year.
"We are incredibly excited to have hosted this event once again and to continue our mission of giving back to the community," said Highsmith. "Providing these resources helps ensure that every child has the tools they need to succeed academically and start the school year with confidence.  
"I know how important education is, especially at a young age. Growing up with both of my parent's educators, it was important to me my who life. That is one of the pillars of my foundation, impacting youth through education. Being able to give back to those kids is such an honor."  
Defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi hosted his third annual Back To School event, providing backpacks and school supplies to 300 kids at Urban Academy in Pittsburgh.
"I love having the opportunity to give every single year and to be an integral part of the start of the school year," said Ogunjobi. "Great school supplies are the foundation of a successful school year, it's always good to come back and see familiar faces, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group of bright students."
Ogunjobi has worked with Urban Academy the past three years, a school known for their S.T.E.M. program, something that hits home for him as he earned his degree in computer science and biology from North Carolina Charlotte.
"The Urban Academy community thanks Larry and the Pittsburgh Steelers for their ongoing commitment to our students and community," said Chase Patterson, CEO of Urban Academy. "For the third consecutive year, Larry's generosity is making a difference in supporting our student's success. Larry and the Steelers organization continue to demonstrate their overarching dedication to uplifting and investing in young people's futures. On behalf of the entire Urban Academy family, thank you for your unwavering support and partnership."
Safety DeShon Elliott is new to Pittsburgh, but he has already immersed himself in the community with his back-to-school event.
"The kids are our pillars. Growing up, football was important to me, but my parents also preached education," said Elliott. "I am not just doing back to school supplies, but clothes and shoes too. It's hard for parents, especially single parent homes, and I have two sisters who are single mothers, and it can be hard to try and provide everything you need for school. That takes a burden off the kids and the moms. The kids can then just focus on their education.
"And this is an opportunity for me to give back to my hometown, which is now here."
Elliott took a group of kids shopping for their back-to-school needs as well as shoes and clothes, making sure they were set for the new school year. He also spent time interacting with the kids, being present, which is sometimes one of the most important aspects.
"It means a lot," said Elliott. "I am giving back, but being there, showing up, that means a lot to kids. Being able to talk to them, and them learning from me, who I am, answering questions. Talking to kids about football, other things. I just want to be hands on and really get to know them."
