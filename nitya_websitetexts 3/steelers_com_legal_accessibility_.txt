The Pittsburgh Steelers (Club) has an ongoing commitment to achieving the highest levels of satisfaction for all aspects of its fans' online experiences. As part of these efforts, the Club is dedicated to offering a quality online experience at its website https://www.steelers.com (the "Website") to fans with disabilities that is full and equal to that provided to fans without disabilities.
To assist in achieving the aforementioned accessibility goals with respect to the Website, the Club has committed to the Website being designed, developed, and operated in substantial conformance with generally recognized and accepted guidelines and/or standards for website accessibility (the "Standards"). While these Standards may change and/or evolve over time, they are currently the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility GuidelinesÂ 2.1Â at Levels A and AA ("WCAG").
As part of these efforts, the National Football League has engaged experienced accessibility consultants, including the National Center for Accessible Media at WGBH ("NCAM"). NCAM is providing training to necessary individuals (including in the Club) on an ongoing basis regarding accessible website design and maintenance. Furthermore, our Website will continue to be assessed on a recurring basis from both an engineering and user-experience basis (including the use of assistive technology (such as screen readers and screen magnifiers), and the involvement of users with disabilities who use such assistive technologies) in order to provide prioritized feedback to the Club regarding substantial conformance with the WCAG.
Of course, as a website is a fluid and ever-evolving platform, and technologies are ever-changing, we acknowledge that website accessibility is an ongoing journey.Â If, along the way, you find yourself having any specific questions, feedback, or concerns about the accessibility of any particular Web pages on https://www.steelers.com, please contact us at accessibility@nfl.com.
