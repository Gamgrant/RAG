Mike TomlinÂ was named the 16th head coach in Pittsburgh Steelers history on January 22, 2007. Hired at the age of 34, Tomlin became only the third head coach hired by the Steelers since 1969.
In his 16 seasons as head coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Tomlin has accomplished many things that have never been done in the team's storied history. A franchise known for stability at the head coaching position, Tomlin ranks among the League's longest-tenured active head coaches entering the 2023 season.
Arthur Smith, previous head coach for the Atlanta Falcons for three years (2021-23), Â is in his ï¬rst season as the Steelersâ oï¬ensive coordinator in 2024. This marks his 16th year in the National Football League coaching ranks.
Under Smith's guidance, the Falcons led the NFL in fewest penalties (2022), ranked third in successful play rate on rushing attempts, based on EPA, (2022), ï¬nished third in rushing yards/game (2022), ninth in rushing yards/game (2023), 10th in third-down conversion rate (2022), 13th in third-down conversion rate (2023) and 13th in passing yards/attempt (2023).
Teryl Austin is in his second season as the Steelersâ defensive coordinator. He was promoted after three seasons as the Steelers' senior defensive assistant/secondary coach on February 6, 2022. This marks his 20th year in the National Football League coaching ranks.
Under the guidance of Austin, Pittsburgh improved from ranking 29th in opponent yards per game to the stingiest defense in the League over the second half of the 2022 season, allowing an NFL-best 272.9 yards per game following their bye week. The Steelers defense also improved in getting off the field through the last nine weeks, allowing the third-least third-down conversions (36) and tying for the second-most interceptions (12). The team's 20 interceptions on the season tied for the most in the League.
Danny Smith is in his 11th season with the Steelers as the special teamsâ coordinator. Smith was hired on January 31, 2013.
