​Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's "Little Italy" - its Italian roots reaching back more than five generations.
The Bloomfield Bridge connects the neighborhood to the universities and cultural attractions in Oakland. Its colorful mix of shops and restaurants are renowned. Bloomfield is a feast as rich to the eyes as the homemade tortellini and cannoli in its shop windows are to the stomach.
Bloomfield figured prominently in Revolutionary War Era accounts of Pittsburgh and Fort Pitt. George Washington's journal described traveling from Liberty Village along "the high ground through a field of many blooms"-hence the name Bloomfield.
Head to Brillobox or Howlers Coyote Café for some great music options, any night of the week.
