Hailed as one of the country's leading training programs for young artists, Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program provides professional development during a two-year session.
Each year, exceptional young singers are selected by audition from more than 800 applicants.
While honing their vocal skills and expanding their repertoire, Resident Artist Singers study languages, diction, movement, and acting. Performance opportunities include principal roles in fully-staged Resident Artist productions, comprimario roles and principal cover roles in Pittsburgh Opera mainstage productions.
The Resident Artist Stage Director serves as Director for a resident artist production, Assistant Director for all mainstage operas, and stages Song Shop Concerts and other events throughout the season.
The Resident Artist Pianist serves as a rehearsal pianist, orchestra pit pianist for select productions, accompanies community engagement events, and receives invaluable mentorship from Pittsburgh Opera’s Music Director and Music Staff.
