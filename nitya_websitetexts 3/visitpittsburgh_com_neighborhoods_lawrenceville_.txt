Home to many artists and designers, this trendy 'ville hosts some of the city's biggest arts events. It's a neighborhood on the rise with affordable properties, first-rate, one-of-a-kind shops and an awesome dining scene. The neighborhood has undergone such a revival that it's called a "go-to" destination by The New York Times. Located less than three miles from Downtown, it's a neighborhood with deep roots too. In fact, composer Stephen Foster's father charted the street plans in 1814.
Walkable and welcoming. Entrepreneurial. Unique and distinct. Old-world charm, modern-day edge.
Named for Captain James Lawrence, hero of War of 1812 and famous for his dying words, "Don't Give Up The Ship!"
Stephen Foster was born here. Every July, this composer of America's first pop songs like "Oh, Susanna" and "Camptown Races," is honored at "Doo Dah Days," a music festival held at the historic Allegheny Cemetery, where Foster is buried alongside other Pittsburgh celebrities.
