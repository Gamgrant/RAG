PROCEDURE FOR ALLEGING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT UNDER
DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT
Steelers will respond to alleged copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). The Privacy Policies do not protect information that Steelers may provide to third parties at its discretion or as required by law through copies of notices referenced below.
A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Third Party Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a written notification pursuant to DMCA by providing Steelers with the following:
1) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
2) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
3) Identification of the Third Party Content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit Steelers to locate the material;
4) Information reasonably sufficient to permit Steelers to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address;
5) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the Third Party Content in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Third Party Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Third Party Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to Steelers at the address set forth below:
2) Identification of the Third Party Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Third Party Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
3) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Third Party Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Third Party Content; and
4) Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Seattle, Washington, USA, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
5) If a counter-notice is received by Steelers, Steelers may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Steelers may replace the removed Third Party Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Third Party Content provider, member or user, the removed Third Party Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Steelers' sole discretion.
6) You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 13, your DMCA notice may not be valid.
7) Steelers will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail or facsimile at the following address: Pittsburgh Steelers LLC, 100 Art Rooney Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15212 Attention: Amy Regan
It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. Steelers may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Steelers may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.
Without limiting Steelers' other rights, Steelers may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer's access to the Site and any other website owned or operated by Steelers.
You should also be aware that we may forward the DMCA Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.
