Enter from the airport through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and see the skyline burst into view. It's why Pittsburgh is said to be the "only city with an entrance." With its lush green hillsides and beautiful rivers, the appropriately nicknamed "Golden Triangle," is a glittering gem. Home to a wealth of historic, cultural and entertainment sites, Downtown is booming with new residential buildings making it the city's fastest-growing neighborhood.
Friendly and welcoming. Comfortable in its city skin. High heels or flip flops, business suit or bathing suit (for sunbathing in Point State Park, of course!)
A 1914 article in the Saturday Evening Post gave the "Golden Triangle" nickname national publicity because the land counted among "the most gilded in the United States, having generated immense wealth."
Best place to see it? Go to "The Point," head under the portal bridge in Point State Park and hang a left, up the ramp to the Fort Pitt Bridge. You won't believe the view. Keep on truckin' and you'll end up at the Duquesne Incline for a full-blown cityscape experience.
