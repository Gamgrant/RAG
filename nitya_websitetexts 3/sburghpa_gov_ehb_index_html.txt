Public service is a public trust. The City's Ethics Code has been enacted to preserve the trust placed in the public servants of the City, to promote public confidence in government, to protect the integrity of government decision making, and to enhance government efficiency. The Ethics Hearing Board is composed of nine members holding reputations of personal integrity and honesty, tasked with enforcement and education regarding the Ethics Code.
