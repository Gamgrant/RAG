The Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations (PghCHR) is a civil rights organization focused on investigating instances of discrimination, providing outreach and education to communities about their rights, and recommending necessary protections in our City Code to provide all people in Pittsburgh with equal opportunities. Our goal is to decrease unfair treatment and discrimination by promoting justice and understanding among communities in the City of Pittsburgh. 
Our office hours are Monday-Friday 9am-5pm. Due to staff working a hybrid schedule, we ask that you please call 412-255-2600 to schedule ahead of time. We cannot take walk-in appointments at this time.
