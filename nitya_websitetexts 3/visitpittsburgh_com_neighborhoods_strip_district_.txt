The Strip, as it's called, is foodie heaven and as authentic as it is fun. Locals love it for its low, low prices and tremendous selections. The one-half square mile shopping district is chock full of ethnic grocers, produce stands, meat and fish markets and sidewalk vendors. Breathe deep because you won't want to escape the splendid aromas of fresh-roasted coffee or just-baked bread. Bordering Downtown, this neighborhood is pure Pittsburgh.
Gritty and authentic. Bursting with local flavor. No pretense, no fluff. Just plain good.
"The Strip," as locals call it, is just that – a narrow strip (one-half mile) of land between the Allegheny River and a mountain of a hill.
After building his first factory in the Strip District in 1871, George Westinghouse not only invented air brakes and AC current, but introduced paid vacations and half-days off on Saturdays.
