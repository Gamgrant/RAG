Shadyside, where boutiques, shops and galleries mingle with national retailers in a neighborhood of tree-lined streets, historic homes, hip events and distinctive restaurants.
And most everything is within walking distance. The large residential area includes beautifully restored Victorian mansions alongside modern homes and condos. This East End neighborhood, with three separate business districts – Ellsworth Avenue, Walnut Street and S. Highland Avenue – is one of Pittsburgh's toniest, and is conveniently located about six miles from Downtown.
Upscale hip. Earthy undertones. Savvy style with modish sensibilities and an academic-fringe factor.
Before it was developed in the mid 1800s, Shadyside was filled with woods and farmlands – complete with shady lanes.
