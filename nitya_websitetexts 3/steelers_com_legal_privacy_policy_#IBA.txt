It is our policy to comply with applicable privacy laws and data protection laws, and so our privacy practices may vary depending on where you live.

Supplemental Disclosures for the Pittsburgh Steelers
We may collect some or all of the following types of information, some of which may be considered sensitive information, including when you register with us, use our Services, sign up for contests or sweepstakes, participate in surveys, create a profile, access various content or features, submit comments or content, use a send-to-a-friend feature, attend events, or directly contact us with questions or feedback:
If you decide not to provide this information, it may limit our ability to provide the Services or some of our content.
We also may collect internet and electronic network activity information, device identifiers, and information about your use of the Services automatically when you visit or use the Services, including:
In addition to information we receive from you and collect automatically, we may receive information about you from other members of the NFL Family and from other sources, such as your friends, social networks, publicly available sources, data brokers, advertising partners, and our business partners and sponsors, including to facilitate co-branded programs. We may combine this data with information we already have about you, including to create inferences about you and your personal preferences.
We may use information that we collect about you for a variety of purposes, including to:
We may disclose each of the categories of personal information described above with others for the purposes described above, including as follows:
Please also note that if you choose to engage in public activities on the Services, such as through interactive features like a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool, you should be aware that the information you share there will be publicly available and can be read, collected, or used by other users of these features. You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when using these features.
We and others use cookies and similar technologies such as beacons, tags, HTML5 local storage, and scripts, to collect information from your browser or device. By using the Services, you acknowledge the use of cookies and similar technologies on the Services, subject to the cookie-related choices we make available to you and, where required by law, your additional consent.
To disable optional cookies, please utilize the Cookie Settings of the applicable website. Additional choices, including with respect to Interest-Based Advertising, are described below under Section 5, Interest-Based Advertising and Section 6, Your Other Choices.
You also may be able to reject cookies and similar technologies through your browser settings. If you reject cookies through your browser settings, you may still use our Services, but your ability to use certain features may be limited.
We partner with third party advertisers, as well as analytics and measurement partners, to serve and display advertising on the Services and elsewhere online across different sites and services.Â Â 
These partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies on the Services and elsewhere online to collect and share information about your activities across different websites, mobile applications, and services to provide you with relevant advertising ("Interest-Based Advertising" or "IBA").Â For example, we may conduct analysis on your behavior in order to provide you with Interest-Based Advertising both on and off the Services.Â We may also disclose non cookie-based information, such as aggregate information (e.g., demographics and usage statistics) to third parties for advertising purposes, including for Interest-Based Advertising.Â To serve and display advertising relevant to your location, the Services may also track your device's precise geolocation by responding to beacons or inaudible signals sent to your device's microphone.Â This is typically done based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.Â Â 
Â You can opt out of receiving some type of ads and third-party collection of data for IBA from your device across unaffiliated services by managing your preferences atÂ https://youradchoices.com/control.
You can also manage third-party cookies that collect data from NFL-affiliated websites and mobile applications for Interest-Based AdvertisingÂ Â by setting your preferences on the website, mobile application, or other service via "Privacy Settings" or "Cookie Settings."
As noted previously, we may disclose your geolocation information, including precise geolocation information, to service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf and to third parties so that they may provide you with geographically relevant advertising.Â 
If you wish to stop the further collection of your geolocation information for IBA, please opt-out using your device settings, as noted below:
To opt out of the tracking of your device geolocation and/or precise geolocation data, please visit your device settings. Turning off access to geolocation and precise geolocation data may disable or interfere with certain functionality or services.
For Android users, please see the following link for instructions on how to opt-out of or withdraw consent to geolocation data collection from your settings https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6179507?hl=en.Â 
For iOS users, please see the following link for instructions on how to opt-out of or withdraw consent to geolocation data collection from your settings https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207092.
The NFL adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles for Interest-Based Advertising.
You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information and the sharing or processing of personal information for Interest-Based Advertising purposes. You can exercise these opt-out choices by visiting "Privacy Settings" or "Cookie Settings."
If you wish to opt out of the sale or sharing for Interest-Based Advertising of online data through the use of cookies, please utilize the Cookie Settings of the applicable website. Our websites also support the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"), which is a browser-based opt-out preference signal that can communicate your opt-out to the websites you visit. For more information on how the GPC works, visit their website here. Because the GPC is browser-based, note that your choices will be tied to online data that is associated with your browser, and you should enable the signal separately for each browser and/or device from which you would like to be opted out.
Note that we do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.
You may also have additional choices available to you, such as certain vendor-specific choices, including:
Do-Not-Track Signals: Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
The NFL works with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services. For example, you can use third-party social networking services to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services. These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services. These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services. Your interactions with those social networking services are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant service.
You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat) to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign into certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Notice.
The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under our control or maintained by us. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. This Privacy Notice does not apply to this third-party content. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.
The security and confidentiality of your personal information is very important to the NFL. We have implemented technical and organizational safeguards designed to appropriately protect your personal information against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful access, use, loss, destruction, or damage. Still, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.
When we transfer your personal information to third parties as described in this Privacy Notice, some of these parties may be located in countries other than your own, such as the United States, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we apply appropriate safeguards, to protect your information in accordance with applicable laws. For example, some NFL entities implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred personal information remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing enquiries@nfl.com. If you would like to know more about the processing of your personal information and whether your personal information is transferred to a third country, please contact us using any of the methods described in Contact Us.
We will retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, considering criteria such as applicable rules on statute of limitations, any legal requirements to retain your personal information in light of compliance obligations, any relevant litigation or regulatory investigations and to enable the NFL to defend or bring potential legal claims, the sensitivity of the relevant information, and the duration of your use of the Services.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children as defined by local law. If we learn that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete it or otherwise comply with applicable law.
You may choose to receive promotional emails, text messages, newsletters, push notifications, and similar communications from us. You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from the applicable Member Club or other members of the NFL Family by clicking on the opt-out or "unsubscribe" link included in the commercial emails you receive.Â You may opt out of receiving marketing text messages from the applicable Member Club or other member of the NFL Family by replying "STOP."Â You may also opt out of receiving push notifications by turning off push notifications through your device settings.
If you have multiple accounts or relationships with different Member Clubs or other NFL entities, you may need to opt out separately for each account and relationship in relation to these choices. In addition, if you would like to opt out of receiving push notifications on all of your devices, you must turn off the feature on each device.
Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective where permitted by applicable law. Your opt-out requests will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature.Â For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages.
You may also have choices available to you to opt out of the collection of your geolocation information, whether collected through location services, Bluetooth, or microphone access technology.Â Where collected, this information may be used in accordance with local laws to serve and display advertising relevant to your location.Â To understand your choices and opt out if desired, please visit your device settings.
You may be afforded, in accordance with applicable law, the following rights:
To exercise your access, deletion, and correction rights, please submit your request by visiting our Data Subject Request Portal. California residents may also exercise their rights under applicable law by calling 1-855-265-6894. If you would like to object to, or request the restriction of, processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent, or if you are otherwise not able to submit a request via the portal above or toll-free number, you can contact the NFL by filling out an inquiry here. Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. If you would like to use an authorized agent to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.
We reserve the right to deny requests as allowed by applicable law, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent, where your identity cannot be confirmed, or where the NFL must retain your information consistent with applicable law. You can, however, appeal those requests that we deny by submitting a request here.
You may also be afforded, in accordance with applicable law, the right to limit certain uses and disclosures of sensitive personal information. You can exercise this right, if applicable, by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link at the footer of our sites or by clicking here. Please note that we may still maintain, use, and disclose your sensitive personal information for certain purposes, such as to provide you with services that you have requested, protect the safety and security of services, and comply with our legal obligations.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you.
Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which a fan mobile pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event. You should therefore expect to be filmed or photographed by CCTV and/or by cameras when you are in a public location at an NFL Event (e.g., as an audience-member in the stadium if you are attending a game). In addition to describing how we capture and use your image, voice and/or likeness in this Privacy Notice, we may also display signs at any NFL Event indicating that you may be filmed or photographed.
We may use your personal information collected at an NFL Event:
Sharing your personal information from an NFL Event: We may disclose your personal information captured at an NFL Event with any of the entities set out in this Privacy Notice, as described in Section 3, Disclosure of Information. Additionally, when you appear in a photograph or film footage at an NFL Event, we may disclose that photograph or film footage containing your image, voice, and/or likeness with our third-party partners. These partners include our sponsors, licensees, advertisers, and/or broadcasters. We will disclose the photographs or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so. However, each of the third-party partners may use your personal information for their independent commercial purposes without reference to the NFL.
Please also note that broadcasters and other third parties that are unconnected to the NFL may be independently filming or photographing you when you attend an NFL Event. Although we only give permission to a small group of entities (such as certain broadcasters) to film or photograph NFL Events, these entities are separate data controllers in respect of your personal information, and the NFL is not responsible for how those parties use your personal information and for what purposes.
We may update this Privacy Notice, including any supplemental privacy disclosures, to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective.Â We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
