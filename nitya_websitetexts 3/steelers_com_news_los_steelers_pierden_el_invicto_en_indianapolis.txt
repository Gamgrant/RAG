Los Pittsburgh Steelers perdieron 24 - 27 ante los IndianÃ¡polis Colts en el partido de la semana 4 de la temporada regular de la NFL. Nuestro equipo perdiÃ³ el invicto en un partido sumamente apretado en la segunda mitad, pero que se complicÃ³ desde que el equipo tuvo una desventaja de 14 puntos en la primera mitad.
Hablemos un poquito mÃ¡s sobre esa primera mitad, los Steelers no tuvieron un buen arranque, la defensiva permitiÃ³ 17 puntos y un prolÃ­fico juego terrestre por parte de los Colts. No es justificaciÃ³n, pero el plan de la defensiva cambiÃ³ sorpresivamente, Anthony Richardson, quarterback de Indy, saliÃ³ lastimado y Joe Flacco entrÃ³ en su lugar. Esto fue lo que comentÃ³ Mike Tomlin al respecto: "Nos preparamos toda la semana para enfrentar a Richardson y luego nos topamos con Flacco y nos tomÃ³ mucho tiempo adaptarnos en diferentes Ã¡reas."  
La ofensiva en los primeros dos cuartos del partido fue inoperante, la secuencia fue despeje, 4ta oportunidad fallida, despeje, y un fumble dolorosÃ­simo de George Pickens en zona roja despuÃ©s de haber recorrido 91 yardas. La Ãºltima jugada del segundo cuarto fue un gol de campo de Boswell de 50 yardas.
En la segunda mitad las cosas mejoraron significativamente, el juego terrestre tuvo mucho mejor desempeÃ±o, especialmente una serie ofensiva que encabezÃ³ Cordarelle Patterson en la que promediÃ³ 7.2 yardas por acarreo en 6 oportunidades pero luego saliÃ³ del partido por una lesiÃ³n en el tobillo. Najee Harris tambiÃ©n saliÃ³ durante algunas jugadas despuÃ©s de atrapar un pase para 32 yardas y vimos el debut de Aaron Shampklin.
Justin Fields no tuvo la mejor de las tardes y aÃºn asÃ­ se las arreglÃ³ para anotar por tierra en un par de ocasiones y un pase de anotaciÃ³n para Pat Freiermuth para acercar a los Steelers. TodavÃ­a vimos un par de errores de conexiÃ³n entre Fraizer y Ã©l y un par de decisiones cuestionables al momento de alargar las jugadas, habrÃ¡ que trabajar sobre eso y especialmente con la protecciÃ³n del balÃ³n, como Ã©l mismo seÃ±alÃ³ en conferencia de prensa tras el partido.
A darle la vuelta a la hoja y a enfocarnos en el siguiente partido en contra de los Dallas Cowboys en Acrisure Stadium y atentos a la cobertura especial que les tenemo esta semana con el evento para fans mexicanos y latinos en Pittsburgh el sÃ¡bado por la tarde y rematando con el partido contra los Vaqueros el domingo por la noche.
