Now is a perfect time to become a Student Ambassador, spreading the word about Pittsburgh Opera and enjoying exclusive benefits!  Established by five intrepid women in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera is viewed as one of the most vibrant opera organizations in the U.S., with a rich artistic tradition, outstanding educational programs, and a progressive outlook toward the future that we want you to be a part of. 
Even if you don’t know much about opera (yet!), if you’re outgoing and enthusiastic then we’d love to work with you. For those interested in a career in arts marketing or education, becoming a Student Ambassador is great opportunity to gain firsthand experience while enhancing your resume.  Student Ambassadors will be asked to hang posters on campus and to be a presence at campus fairs/events.  Most importantly, we want to hear YOUR ideas about how best to share Pittsburgh Opera with your fellow students.
If you can entice your fellow students to buy tickets over the course of the season, you can earn even more benefits!
Please contact us via email letting us know why you would make a great Ambassador and an example of how you’d like to promote the opera on campus. We look forward to hearing from you!
Pittsburgh Opera knows that the opera stars we love to see on stage would never be able to share the beauty and thrill of the operatic voice without the teachers that helped them along the way. We want to share our love for all voice teachers out there and connect with those who love opera singers as much as we do.
Pittsburgh Opera’s Voice Teacher Ambassador program is a new initiative designed for teachers both locally and beyond to enjoy exclusive benefits, share their perspective, and help continue to spread the operatic joy that Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to bringing to the public. Established by five intrepid women in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera is viewed as one of the most vibrant opera organizations in the U.S., with a rich artistic tradition, outstanding educational programs, and a progressive outlook toward the future that we want you to be a part of.
Whether you are a seasoned professor working in a university or run a dedicated private vocal studio, if you are enthusiastic about developing the voices of the world’s opera divas then we’d love to work with you. Voice Teacher Ambassadors will be asked to share Pittsburgh Opera’s digital season of free operatic performances with their students and, as we return to in-person live theater, encourage their students to visit our stages and experience our productions first hand (special student priced tickets are always available). Most importantly, we want to hear YOUR ideas about how best to share Pittsburgh Opera with your students. Please contact us via email to discuss. We look forward to hearing from you!
