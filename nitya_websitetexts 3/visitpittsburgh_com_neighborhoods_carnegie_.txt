A vibrant community with a unique history make this up-and-comer worth visiting.
Six miles from Downtown Pittsburgh sits the bustling Carnegie borough. Enjoy a walk along Main Street and explore shops and restaurants reflecting the diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds of the community.
The borough was named after Andrew Carnegie in return for his gift of both Carnegie High School which he had built and the Andrew Carnegie Free Library & Music Hall which he had built and endowed, and which still keeps watch over the community from its perch atop Library Hill today.
On the second Friday of each month, get into the action at the Carnegie Crawl 5pm-9pm.
