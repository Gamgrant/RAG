      "Content (snippet): During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[29] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[47][48] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[49]\n",
      "Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11]\n",

      "Content (snippet): Under the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[71][72][73] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.[74] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.[75]\n",
